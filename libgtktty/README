* General information

Libgtktty is an additional library for the Gtk+ toolkit. The
first intention for writing this library was to provide a
basic framework for tty like displays in a Gtk+ widget for
the GemVt program (GNU Emulator of a Virtual Terminal).

This is beta software.


* Licensing

The Gtk+ widgets GtkTerm, GtkTty (together with GtkEmuVt) and GtkLed are
released under the terms of the GNU LGPL (GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE).
Read the file COPYING.LIB for more information.

* Requirements

The widgets of libgtktty depend on a couple of extra packages
for working properly:

	- The latest Gtk+: This is the release of the Gtk+ toolkit.
	  You can find Gtk+ releases at:
	  
	  ftp://ftp.gimp.org/pub/gtk/


* Getting GemVt/Libgtktty

GemVt has it's own web page from which you can also get the latest release
of libgtktty:
