1998-07-13  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* tests/lynxdump.sh: Sed out the /tmp/.$$.html filename from the
	output. 
	* expected/fileconvert.out: Update to reflect this.

	* tests/skel.c (main): `gnomelib_init' has one argument now.
	* tests/split.c (main): Likewise.
	* tests/fileconvert.c (main): Likewise.  Also, look for input file
	in $srcdir.
	* tests/trigs.c (main): Likewise.

	* runtest.sh: Cleanup.
	(LINK): Give the output of the LINK a name.

	Based partly on patch from James Michael Mastros

1998-06-11  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	Improve test harness.
	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Add GTK_CFLAGS.
	(dummy.c): Hack to force `automake' to define $COMPILE and $LINK.
	(TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Pass $COMPILE and $LINK in environment to
	runtest.sh.

	* runtest.sh: Reorganized.  Makes better use of automake/libtool
	machinery to build and execute the tests.  Should work for
	builddir != srcdir.

	* Makefile.am (bin_PROGRAMS): Removed.
