	Improve test harness.
	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Add GTK_CFLAGS.
	(dummy.c): Hack to force `automake' to define $COMPILE and $LINK.
	(TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Pass $COMPILE and $LINK in environment to
	runtest.sh.

	* runtest.sh: Reorganized.  Makes better use of automake/libtool
	machinery to build and execute the tests.  Should work for
	builddir != srcdir.
