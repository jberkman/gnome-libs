	* zterm.c (child_died_event): New function, exits.  This is the
	signal handler for the "child_died" event.

	* zvtterm.c (zvt_term_destroy): Added call to zvt_term_closepty
	and vtx_destroy, to clean up emulator resources.  Not sure if its
	working right though.
	(zvt_term_init): Removed some redundant code.
	(zvt_term_child_died): Default signal handler for child death.
	Does nothing.
	(zvt_term_readdata): Emits "child_died" signal when read fails.
	(zvt_term_class_init): Added "child_died" signal creation to
	class.

	* vt.c (vt_init): Sets the line number on initialisation of
	lines.  Maybe cleaner rendering on startup?

	* zvtterm.c (zvt_term_destroy): Added call to vtx_destory.

	* vt.c (vt_destory): New function.  Cleans up memory associated
	with vt run-time.  Scrollback and lines.  Closes child file
	descriptor.

	* update.c (vtx_destroy): New function.  Cleans up the vtx
	structure and free's it.

	* zvtterm.c (zvt_term_killchild): New function.  Calls
	vt_killchild().
	(zvt_term_forkpty): Checks validity of arguments.  Also doesn't
	allow a 'forked terminal' to fork again.
	(zvt_term_closepty): New function.  Close the child's process
	master terminal, and removes the gdk input handler.  Logical
	inverse of zvt_term_forkpty()

	* vt.h (vt_closepty): Added api functions killchild/closepty.
	Perhaps it should also SIGHUP the child?

	* vt.c (vt_killchild): New function.  Sorry about the name.
	Equivalent of 'kill(2)'.
	(vt_closepty): Inverse of forkpty().  Just closes the master pty.

	* zvtterm.h: Added fore_last and back_last to keep track of the
	last foreground/background colour used in the fore/back_gc's.

	* update.c (vt_update): Added initialisation of fn and firstline
	so that gcc won't complain about logic it couldn't follow.

	* zvtterm.c (vt_scroll_area): Clears the scrolled area using the
	term->back_gc, which cleans up scrolling.
	(vt_term_realize): Initialises fore_last/back_last.
	(vt_draw_text): Removed static variables last_fore, last_back to
	term->fore_last, term->back_last.

	* vt.h (VTATTR_BACK_SET): Added two new attribute flags to
	indicate if explicit foreground or background have been set. 

	* zvtterm.c (zvt_term_class_init): New overwritten method:
	unrealize
	(zvt_term_unrealize): Relese resources allocated on the realize
	method. 
	(zvt_term_realize): Allocate a color context for the foreground
	and one for the backgroudn;  Allocate colors with the gdk color
	context code.  
	(vt_draw_text): Add color support. 

	* vt.c (vt_mode): fix, process any number of arguments to the mode
	escape sequence.

	* zvtterm.c (zvt_term_key_press): Backspace sends ^H; Delete sends
	\177, and KP_Delete sends \033[3~.

	* zvtterm.c (vt_scroll_area): Generates and processes graphics_expose
		events when scrolling from off-window areas.

	* update.c (vt_update_rect): Modified to keep old state of cursor
		on exit.
		(vt_update): Modified to keep old state of cursor on exit.

	* zvtterm.c (vt_cursor_state): Modified to return the previous
		state of the cursor.

1998-04-26  Michael Zucchi  <zucchi@zzedzone.box.net.au>

	* memory.c: renamed mem_* functions to vt_mem_* functions.

	* update.c (vt_get_selection): Added a sanity check to
		ensure the selection lines exist.

	* zterm.c (main): Added scrollbar.
		Added -s <number> scrollback size option.
		Added call to zvt_term_set_font_name().

	* vt.c (vt_delete_char): Fixed typo in if test.
	(vt.c): Removed globals inadvertantly left in the code.
		Renamed mem_* functions to vt_mem_* functions.
	(vt_scrollback_set): New function.
	(parse_vt): Now reads \E] command - set text options, although
		does not process it.
		Multiple arguments were being passed to \EM command
		- reverse scroll, wrongly.
	(vt_modeh/l): Detects/removes application cursor key mode.
	
	* zvtterm.c (zvt_term_fix_scrollbar): Added new function.
		Signals adjustemnt when a change occurs.
	(zvt_term_size_allocate): Added call to zvt_term_fix_scrollbar.
	(zvt_term_readdata): Added call to zvt_term_fix_scrollbar.
	(zvt_term_init): Fixed signal connect to point to the term widget.
	(zvt_term_scrollbar_moved): Implemented adjustment change callback.
	(zvt_term_selection_handler): Changed to void.  Fixed g_return() macros.
	(zvt_term_size_request): Added input validation.
	(vt_draw_text): Added input validation.
	(vt_scroll_area): Added input validation.
	(zvt_term_init): Added cast to gtk_adjustment_new().
	(zvt_term_set_scrollback): New function.  Calls vt_scrollback_set
		and fixes the scrollbar too.
	(zvt_term_set_fonts): New function.  Sets fonts.
