No real order here, but the magic selections seems neat to play with.

- Optimise scroll-back buffer scrolling
 - Speed up viewing of the scrollback buffer.

- Proper attribute support.
 - Colour support (less important in my books, but some people ...)

- Magic selection
 - some sort of regex pattern maching scheme to recognise matches
   near the selection point.
 - some sort of classing engine to map matches to functions.
 - merge into the selection code as a selection type.
 - maybe use the dingus stuff, or maybe not ...

- Selections
 - Render selections properly if new selections or if refreshed/
   scrolled selections.  This has mostly been done.

- Capture.  To file, or to pipe.
 - Screen dump/print?
 - Save scrollback?
 - Put this in zterm, not ZvtTerm widget.

- Menus in Zterm (and other stuff)
 - options menu
  - reset, blink option
 - operations menu
  - send signals, etc.
 - fonts

- VT/Xterm emulation
 - such as report terminal type
 - some more rigourous testing

- XTerm title setting escape sequence.  Partly done.  Read in,
  just not processed.

- XTerm mouse-reporting stuff.  This is partly done.
