If you want to hack on the GNOME project, it will make you life easier
to have the following packages installed:

	- GNU autoconf 2.12
	- GNU automake 1.2d
		Available in ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/tromey
	- GNU libtool 1.0f
	- GNU guile 1.2
	- GNU gettext 0.10.32
	- SLIB 2b3
		See http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/~jaffer/SLIB.html

These should be available by ftp from prep.ai.mit.edu or any of the
fine GNU mirrors.  Beta software can be found at alpha.gnu.org.

If you are accessing gnome via CVS, then you will need to take several
steps to get it to compile.  These are:

    cvsroot/gnome# aclocal -I macros; automake; autoconf
    cvsroot/gnome# cd libgtktty; aclocal; automake; autoconf; cd ..

N.b., the "configure" script will not exist until you take these
steps.  The last step is in case you have not installed the DocBook
packages.  These are still esoteric enough that we are not requiring
you to install them to build GNOME.

Before running configure, make sure you have libtool in your path.

There is a simple script (autogen.sh) on the root directory that does
all of this for you.  Just run this script with any arguments that you
want to pass to configure.  If you like to build in a directory
different from the source, you can run `$srcdir/autogen.sh' in the
build directory, and it will deduce $srcdir.

Please submit patches to the gnome-list@gnome.org mailing list.  All
kinds of contributions are accepted. If at all possible, please use
CVS to get the latest development version of gnome; the README file
has the CVSROOT information.

				 FAQ

Q1. `aclocal' complains that there is no AM_ACLOCAL_INCLUDES?

A1. You invoked `aclocal' without `-I macros'.  The `macros' subdir
contains other macros that are used for `gnome' configure.in files.
By omitting the `-I macros' you will not pick up those definitions.

The definition of AM_ACLOCAL_INCLUDES is also in the `macros' subdir,
and this macro is named such that `aclocal' will complain if its
definition is not found.

If you use the `autogen.sh' script, all this is taken care of for you.

Q2. What is AM_ACLOCAL_INCLUDES

A2. This macro ensures that aclocal is invoked with `-I macros'.

    - One way it does that is it sets the $(ACLOCAL) Makefile variable
    to included `-I macros'.

    - The other way is to cause Q1 ;-).
