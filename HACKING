If you want to hack on the GNOME project, it will make your life easier
to have the following packages installed:

	- GNU m4 1.4
	- GNU texinfo 3.12 (for makeinfo 1.68)
	- GNU autoconf 2.13
	- GNU libtool 1.3.3
	- GNU gettext 0.10.35
	- GNU automake 1.4
	- GNU guile 1.3a
	- SLIB 2c3 (See http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/~jaffer/SLIB.html)

These should be available by ftp from prep.ai.mit.edu or any of the
fine GNU mirrors.  Prerelease software can be found at alpha.gnu.org.

If you are accessing gnome via CVS, then you will have to run the
autogen.sh script with any possible arguments that you might want to
pass to configure.

    cvsroot/gnome# ./autogen.sh --prefix=/opt/gnome

If you like to build in a directory different from the source, you can
run `<path-to-src-dir>/autogen.sh' in the build directory.

Please submit patches to the gnome-list@gnome.org mailing list.  All
kinds of contributions are accepted. If at all possible, please use
CVS to get the latest development version of gnome; the README file
has the CVSROOT information.
