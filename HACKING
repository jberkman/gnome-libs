If you want to hack on the GNOME project, it will make your life easier
to have the following packages installed:

	- GNU m4 1.4
	- GNU texinfo 3.12 (for makeinfo 1.68)
	- GNU autoconf 2.13
	- GNU libtool 1.3.4
	- GNU gettext 0.10.35
	- GNU automake 1.4

These should be available by ftp from ftp.gnu.org or any of the
fine GNU mirrors.  Prerelease software can be found at alpha.gnu.org.

If you are accessing gnome via CVS, then you will want to run the
autogen.sh script with any possible arguments that you might want to
pass to configure.

    cvsroot/gnome# ./autogen.sh --prefix=/opt/gnome

If you like to build in a directory different from the source, you can
run `<path-to-src-dir>/autogen.sh' in the build directory.

Please submit patches via the GNOME bug tracking system
(submit@bugs.gnome.org, or preferably use the included gnome-bug script),
or to gnome-libs-maint@gnome.org. All kinds of contributions are accepted.
If at all possible, please use CVS to get the latest development version
of gnome; the README file has the CVSROOT information.
