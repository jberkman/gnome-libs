For users-faq-1.2/

   <qandaentry id="makemoneyfast">
	Is it worth adding a question here about "How can I give GNOME
  	money?" and suggesting GNU/FSF/Gnome Foundation?

platforms.sgml
   <qandaentry id="runson"> 
	Any more?
   <qandaentry id="no-run-on"> 
	Any more?
   <qandaentry id="windowmanagers">
        Please do not change this to "Sawfish is the default" unless
	and until GNOME changes its policy and starts saying "we're not
	wm-agnostic any more".

installing.sgml
    <qandaentry id="get-not-helix">
	_Are_ there people who will supply up to date GNOME CDs?
	Gnome Foundation, perhaps? :)

compiling.sgml
   <qandaentry id="doublegnome">
	This question no answer.
   <qandaentry id="rh-locale-fix">
	Merely unset LOCALES, or LANGUAGE, LANG and LC_ALL? 

starting.sgml
   <qandaentry id="start-from-x">
	Foolproof simple methods which don't break {g|x|k}dm  to do this 
	requested.

using.sgml
   <qandaentry id="speedy-gnome">
	Any more?
   <qandaentry id="rh61-bug">
	Ideally, knowing which single/few package(s) cause this would be 
	better. Any clue?
   <qandaentry id="gmc-nonroot-troubles">
	This needs an answer!
   <qandaentry id="network-lookup">
	Should they also put their machine in as its own nameserver or
	something? 

extras.sgml
   <qandaentry id="package-jobs">
	Probably needs correcting. This is the users FAQ, so examples
	rather than abstract coding principles are good.
   <qandaentry id="other-unstable">
	What _does_ oaf do, or provide? In simple terms? Please? :)
	Is it going to replace something else?
	Is the description of gconf accurate?

resources.sgml
   <qandaentry id="info-local">
	What are the *BSD and Solaris equivalents of /usr/doc etc?
   <qandaentry id="info-net">
	Where is the RH users' list and why did it take me five minutes
	to locate all the other distros but yet after some years of
	using RH I have not found this yet?
	Are there lists which deal specifically with X newbie/user problems?
        Are there newsgroups which deal with GNOME?
        What about links for getting GNOME to compile and run on other
	platforms? Even Solaris users post regularly to GNOME list, 
	and that's hardly "less common". Where are resources for AIX,
	IRIX and so on?

Possible additions:
	ut8f support in gnome-terminal and its usage.
	gnome-foundation.
	where to give money. :)
	mention of CDE (so the Solaris users read it and go, "Oh, 
        that's what it does!")
        Sort some of the "using" section into "problems" section.

The whole of the developer FAQ needs doing by someone who understands
GNOME coding.
