        I see I did not do _any_ of the below. They all need looking at.
        Huge updating required in general. Creating a 1.4 and 2.0 pair
        of users-faq-x.y/ directories _with contents_ before 2.2 comes
        out might also be a suggestion.

        XML-ification. 

        Do feel free to tidy 1.2ness up, or to create a parallel 1.4
        one for the ongoing 1.4.1 branch of Gnome. I would like to do
        the 2.0 one myself, but if you can actually complete it before
        I start, you probably should.

For users-faq-1.2/
whatis.sgml
   <qandaentry id="makemoneyfast">
	Is it worth adding a question here about "How can I give GNOME
  	money?" and suggesting GNU/FSF/Gnome Foundation?

platforms.sgml
   <qandaentry id="windowmanagers">
        Please do not change this to "Sawfish is the default" unless
	and until GNOME changes its policy and starts saying "we're not
	wm-agnostic any more".

installing.sgml
    <qandaentry id="get-not-helix">
	_Are_ there people who will supply up to date GNOME CDs?
	Gnome Foundation, perhaps? :)

compiling.sgml
   <qandaentry id="doublegnome">
	Answer needs checking.
   <qandaentry id="rh-locale-fix">
	Merely unset LOCALES, or LANGUAGE, LANG and LC_ALL? 

starting.sgml
   <qandaentry id="start-from-x">
	Foolproof simple methods which don't break {g|x|k}dm  to do this 
	requested.

using.sgml
   <qandaentry id="speedy-gnome">
	Any more?
   <qandaentry id="changing-wms">
	Ideally, knowing which single/few package(s) cause this would be 
	better. Any clue?
   <qandaentry id="gmc-nonroot-troubles">
	This needs an answer!
   <qandaentry id="network-lookup">
	Should they also put their machine in as its own nameserver or
	something? 

extras.sgml

resources.sgml
   <qandaentry id="info-local">
	What are the *BSD and Solaris equivalents of /usr/doc etc?
   <qandaentry id="info-net">
        Are there newsgroups which deal with GNOME?
        What about links for getting GNOME to compile and run on other
	platforms? Even Solaris users post regularly to GNOME list, 
	and that's hardly "less common". Where are resources for AIX,
	IRIX and so on?

Possible additions:
	ut8f support in gnome-terminal and its usage.
	gnome-foundation.
	where to give money. :)
	mention of CDE (so the Solaris users read it and go, "Oh, 
        that's what it does!")
        Sort some of the "using" section into "problems" section.

The whole of the developer FAQ needs doing by someone who understands
GNOME coding.
