      <acronym>GNOME</acronym> is fun! How do I get more involved?

    <para>
      There's a hundred ways. Hackers can skip straight to the
      <ulink type="http" url="http://developer.gnome.org">developer site</ulink>
      for things that need doing. If you want to help with development and
      you know C or another language used by GNOME, just look for missing
      software or missing features in existing software. Then contact the
      people listed in the <filename>MAINTAINERS</filename>,
      <filename>README</filename> or <filename>AUTHORS</filename> files in
      the source tarball telling them what you did or want to do. GNOME
      development is completely open. Anyone can join in.

      Do I need to learn C to help with <acronym>GNOME</acronym>?

    <para>      
      No! Well, you can if you want, but GNOME has bindings for a 
      bunch of other languages if you prefer those. If you don't want
      to learn coding at all, don't feel you have to. There are
      plenty of other things that need doing and which have plenty of
      people willing to help you start:

        If you figure out how to do something, write it up and make
        it available for others to use: send it to gnome-list, put it
        on the web, and so on.

        If you figure out how to break something, report it! Bug reports
        are Good and Wonderful. There is even a program to help you write
        them and include all the relevant information: it's called
        <application>bug-buddy</application>.

        If you like writing -- or checking other people's writing -- 
        consider getting involved with the <ulink type="http" 
        url="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gdp/">GNOME Documentation
        Project</ulink> and writing documentation: whether of APIs,
        applications, applets, how to alter something, anything you
        can't find described which you once needed to know. The GDP
        folks will try to help you as best they can.

        If you speak a language other than English, consider getting

        Project</ulink>: people translating the programs and documents 
        into their own languages.

        Can you draw? Are you feeling generous enough to draw icons
        or create themes? Please feel free to. The <ulink type="http"
        url="http://gnome-icons.sourceforge.net">GNOME Icons Project</ulink>
        is always looking for icons that sit well with GNOME.

        One way of helping GNOME is to avoid getting into rows about
        desktop environments, licences, window managers, Linux distributions
        and UNIX flavours. Honestly. It's lots of fun for many people,
        but it puts another group of people right off. "Why my preferred
        choice is good" is one thing. "Why everything else is rubbish" is
        not helpful. Really.
