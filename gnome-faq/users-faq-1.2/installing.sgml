      What are the basic system requirements if I want to use GNOME?
    </para>

   <answer>
    <para>
      A computer running one of the flavours of UNIX, Linux, *BSD and
      so on listed above, which is also capable of running the X Window
      System. You <emphasis>can</emphasis> get by with 16Mb of RAM, but 
      32Mb is much much nicer and probably what most people would consider
      a minimum now. Many people like more.  As for space on the hard drive: 
      you will certainly need at least 30Mb to install core binaries. If you
      want to compile the sources yourself, you're looking at 200Mb.

    <para>
      Software you want on there already: <application>X</application>:
      most people use <application>XFree86</application> but some go
      for the commercial versions instead. You will also need: GTK+, glib,
      esound, ORBit, gdk-pixbuf, imlib, audiofile and libxml. All of
      these come with GNOME.

      So where do I get GNOME?

    <para>
      Most Linux distributions ship with more or less current versions
      of <application>GNOME</application> on the CDs. If you are running
      Linux, you probably have it already. Note that Caldera OpenLinux
      does not ship GNOME: but there are rumoured to exist GNOME rpms on 
      Caldera's contrib site. <!-- I can't find them. Where are they? -->
    </para>
    <para>
      <application>GNOME</application> is constantly moving ahead, and
      even three months can see huge changes in it. Announcements of
      individual package updates are posted almost daily. You will find
      the tarballs for these on the GNOME site and its mirrors. Vendors
      also periodically update their packaging of 
      <application>GNOME</application>, but they have a great many other
      packages to maintain and update too.

      For those with good internet connections, the fastest and simplest
      way to acquire <application>GNOME</application> can be to visit
      <ulink type="http" url="http://www.helixcode.com/desktop/download.php3">their
      download page</ulink> and follow the directions there, which
      involves an automatic installation. This applies to people running 
      any of the above except Debian.

        If you are a new GNOME user, run
        <command>apt-get install task-helix-core</command> to get the
        core parts of it, or 
        <command>apt-get install task-helix-gnome</command> to get all
        the applications.

    <para>
      If you can't or don't want to get Helix from the net, then the obvious
      fallback is the tarballs which you can collect from the 
      <ulink type="ftp" url="ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/">GNOME
      FTP site</ulink> or any of its
      <ulink type="http" url="http://www.gnome.org/ftpmirrors.shtml">mirrors</ulink>.
      <emphasis>Please</emphasis> use the mirrors: that's why they're there.
      Or there is the packaging from your distributor.

      GNOME is available for BSD users through the ports system.
      Solaris does not (yet!) ship GNOME, but binaries and source-building
      instructions are both available on Paul Barnfather's excellent
      <ulink type="http" url="http://www.clanger9.demon.co.uk/computer/gnome/">Building
      GNOME on Solaris</ulink> page.

      If the problem is the net connection, the size of the download or the
      cost of being online that long, then I sympathise. Increasingly,
      when GNOME people are at Linux shows, they try to have CDs of recent
      <application>GNOME</application> releases available. If you have
      friends with net connections and CD burners: well, it's all free
      software so you are at liberty to get someone to make you a CD.
      You may be able to ask around and find someone who will post you
      one, but I don't know.

  <qandaentry id="dont-get-cvs">
   <question>
    <para>
      I hear and see people talk about running "the latest CVS"? What's
      this?
    </para>
   </question>
   <answer>
    <para>
      CVS (<application>Concurrent Versioning System</application>)
      is where all the source code for GNOME lives. Anyone can check it
      out and put it on their local machine, and gnome hackers can
      add new code in. With some hundred-odd people checking code in
      constantly (dozens of changes daily), there's the risk that
      occasionally (some might claim, commonly) things get slightly 
      (again some might say, badly) broken.
    </para>
    <para>
      CVS has separate <quote>modules</quote>: there's gnome-core, 
      gnome-libs, gnome-games and so on. When the code in a module is 
      working and stable, the maintainer of that module packages it up 
      neatly into a tarball and puts it up for FTP. Sometime s/he makes 
      rpms and debs, too. Sometimes that's done by other people who feel 
      like being helpful. It then gets announced as a new tarball. 
    </para>
    <para>
      CVS is in a constant state of flux, and code from it is not even
      guaranteed to compile. (It's all source: there's no binaries in
      there.) Consequently, it is not at all recommended that you
      start with GNOME by playing with CVS code: the compilation method 
      is different, it probably won't compile, and if it does, it may eat 
      your favourite GNOME settings. The tarballs are made as soon as there 
      are substantial changes and bug fixes in: if a package is perfect and 
      needs no changes then there won't be many releases. If lots of cool 
      things have been fixed, it's not unknown for three successive tarballs 
      to come out in a week. All in all, there's not a lot to gain from 
      running CVS code unless you're a developer, (or documenter, or 
      translator) although a lot of people check out the code just to read it.
    </para>
    <para>
      All that said, if you want to try and compile and run CVS code,
      you're more than welcome. But consider yourself warned in advance :)
