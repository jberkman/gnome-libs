      The list of <acronym>GNOME</acronym> packages is colossal. Do
      I need them all?

      You certainly need a lot of them. The idea of having many packages
      is for several reasons:

        It keeps things modular. Small components can be reused by
        multiple programs over and over again.

      <para>
        It is a big help to those on slow connections or with slow
        machines. They can be extremely selective about what they 
        download or install. Whilst gnome-libs is an essential, for
        example, not that many people need gnome-pilot, and they can
        omit it happily.

        It's a lot easier to issue bugfixes and security fixes when
        packages are small and split up: you only need to reissue one
        smallish package instead of one very large one. 
      </para>
     </listitem>

         It spreads the load. Maintaining small packages is hard enough.
         Maintaining large ones is very hard work.

      Okay, here's a quick run-down of GNOME components with particularly 
      mystifying names. It is not intended to be technical: for that, you'll 
      need to look at the developer FAQ. But it might help.

        Lots of the packages are libraries which make it simpler for
        programmers to program things for <application>X</application>,
        which is a big and complicated beast. So if a program uses one
        of the libraries, you need the library installed. These packages

           ORBit is what provides CORBA, and CORBA is what lets different

           GTK is the Gimp ToolKit. It is a library which the

          borrowed. It lets people create buttons, scrollbars, menus and 
          other basic "widgets" in a consistent way when writing an

          Imlib is a rendering library. It's responsible for telling X how
          to draw things and how to load images. Many GNOME programs require
          this, but some can use, or even require, gdk-pixbuf instead, which 
          is a newer library performing the same function.

          glib contains coding routines which are used by almost all GNOME

          GNOME needs to be able to understand files which use XML (a format
          for describing information contained in something). libxml lets
          it do that.
        </para>
        <para>
          libxml is sometimes referred to as gnome-xml.  This is because 
          the libxml package is stored as gnome-xml on the GNOME CVS server.

          Many GNOME programs need libglade. This is a library which reads

          GNOME wants to be able to get information about filesystem
          organisation and how the system controls what runs when. This
          varies on different forms of UNIX. The details of how to do it
          go in here, so programmers can just call this, whatever platform
          the program runs on. It is called libgtop after the traditional
          way to display this information: the 'top' program.

          Many GNOME programs need to be able to use HTTP. The library

          libghttp is sometimes referred to as gnome-http.  This is because

          The esound server is something which takes all the requests
          for "Make a noise" that GNOME produces and feeds them to the

          at the same time.

          Writing programs which involve printing is hard: it has to
          take into account everything from what language the printer
          understands to how to parcel up the information that is going
          from the program to the various parts of the printing system.
          A new library is trying to put all of this into one place so
          that programs can use the library and not have to do all the
          complicated stuff themselves. This is gnome-print, which is
          now a requirement if you want to use <application>Gnumeric</application>.

      to start <application>GnoRPM</application>, browse through the
      packages (GNOME packages are largely in User Interface/Desktops
      or Development/Libraries), select a package, and hit

      <command>rpm -qi packagename</command> at the command line.
      Debian users can use the command <command>dpkg -p package</command>,
      which will return information whether or not the package is

      in a stable state. They are both in CVS, and you are at liberty
      to collect them and try to compile them yourself, but they're not
