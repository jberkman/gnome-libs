       Where can I find information located on my machine?

    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
       Information is scattered all over the place. You can use the
       GNOME help browser (<command>gnome-help-browser</command> at
       the command line or select <menuchoice><guimenu>Programs</guimenu>
       <guimenuitem>Help system</guimenuitem></menuchoice> from the main
       GNOME menu) to browse most of these sources. A brief listing on a
       UNIX box would include the manual pages (<command>man gnome</command>),
       the info pages (<command>info gnome</command>), the documentation
       directory (usually <filename class="directory">/usr/doc/</filename>
       but it may be <filename class="directory">/usr/share/doc/</filename>
       on some systems) for packages, and the 
       <application>GNOME</application>-specific documentation for the
       GNOME help browser. You can also use your package management 
       tool as described earlier.

         There are a variety of mailing lists for different purposes. The
         main mailing list page is at <ulink type="http"
         url="http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/">
         http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/</ulink>. Some lists
         are hosted elsewhere. If the list you are looking for is not
         at the above link, check out the old list of mailing lists at
         <ulink type="http" url="http://www.gnome.org/mailing-lists/">
         http://www.gnome.org/mailing-lists/</ulink> -- but be aware
         if something is listed on the first page (the 
         <application>mailman</application>-run one) then you want to
         use that link. The second one is purely provided as a way to
         find the lists which weren't moved onto 
         <application>mailman</application>.

        <title>gnome-list and on-topicness</title>
        <para>
          The gnome-list mailing list in particular gets a lot of traffic,
          because people often aren't sure where to ask questions or simply
          don't know where to ask. It's really not the best place for
          X-related problems, distribution-related problems, questions on 
          how to mount a filesystem, perform backups, or what people's
          favourite mailers are.

          For these and other non-GNOME questions, there are other mailing
          lists. Here's a partial list of where to look:
