    <question>
     <para>
       Everything is HUGE!
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
       This is commonly met by people who are used to Macintosh or
       MS Windows systems and are now using XFree86 on a GNU/Linux box.
       <application>X</application> can run at different resolutions.
       When it is first configured, the various programs to configure
       X (<application>Xconfigurator</application>, 
       <application>XF86Setup</application>, <application>SaX</application>
       and so on) will look at video card details and pick "safe" 
       resolutions, which are generally low. Often they will pick a 
       variety. If you have a low resolution, you can try experimenting with
       <keycombo>
        <keycap>control</keycap>
        <keycap>alt</keycap>
        <keycap>+</keycap>
       </keycombo> and
       <keycombo>
        <keycap>control</keycap>
        <keycap>alt</keycap>
        <keycap>-</keycap>
       </keycombo>
       (NB: these refer to <keycap>+</keycap> and <keycap>-</keycap> on the
       numberpad pad of the keyboard) to cycle through other available 
       resolutions. If not a lot happens, and you are confident that your 
       monitor and card can handle it, you can re-run the setup tool of your 
       choice for X and feed it different values, or <emphasis>if you know 
       what you're doing</emphasis> you can attempt to edit the 
       <filename>XF86Config</filename> which holds the relevant values 
       yourself. Editing this is not the recommended first tactic: if you 
       must try it, take a backup copy of the file first. Don't be tempted
       to change things when you're not sure: this is one of the few
       ways you can actually damage hardware. (Far less true than it
       used to be, but it's worth being aware of this before trying it.)

     <para>
       If you are still stuck with 640x480 or 800x600 and one of the 
       huge things is the panel, you have a couple of options. First,
       you can use the arrows at the end of it and tidy it away when 
       you don't need it. Or you can use the autohide feature so that
       it hides mostly offscreen until you move the mouse over it. If
       you are using gnome-core-1.1.x or gnome-core-1.2.x, then there is
       also an option to shrink the width of the panel, available by
       right-clicking on the panel and following
       <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>Panel</guimenu>
        <guisubmenu>Properties</guisubmenu>
        <guisubmenu>Size</guisubmenu>
       </menuchoice>
       and picking <guimenuitem>Small</guimenuitem> or
       <guimenuitem>Tiny</guimenuitem>.
     </para>
     <para>
       If applications habitually open so large that they go off the
       edge of the screen, you should be able to resize them with your
       window manager before closing. On re-opening, applications which
       are session-managed by GNOME should re-open at the new size. If you
       can't get to parts of the application, your window manager probably
       has a way to move the window about without using the titlebar of
       the window. For <application>WindowMaker</application> and
       <application>Enlightenment</application>, the default way to do
       this is to hold the <keycap>alt</keycap> button down, and then
       move it with <mousebutton>mouse button 2</mousebutton> (the middle
       button). For <application>Sawfish</application>, it's the same
       but <mousebutton>mouse button 1</mousebutton> (the left button).

   <!-- from Dan Mueth --> 
    <question>
     <para>
       Why do I get <errorname>Gdk-WARNING **: shmget failed!</errorname>
       when I try to run some programs?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      This error indicates that the application is not able to get
      a shared memory segment.  There are a number of reasons why
      this could happen, including:
     </para>
     <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        shared memory is not set up (properly) on the system
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        all shared memory segments are being used
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </orderedlist>
     <para>
      GNOME and Gdk applications use a lot of shared memory
      segments (typically 6 segments per process that uses
      shared memory), so it is possible your system was not
      configured with enough segments to support GNOME with a
      lot of applications running.  (Note that many GNOME applications
      can be run without using shared memory by starting them with
      the flag <option>--no-xshm</option>.)
     </para>
     <para>
      The following instructions apply for the Linux kernel. 
      <!-- Does this problem arise on other kernels? --> 
      First, find out the maximum number of shared memory segments
      your kernel is configured for by typing <command>ipcs -l</command>.
      Look for the line starting with <quote>max number of
      segments = </quote>.  If it is 128 or less, it is likely that
      this is not enough.  Depending on how many applications and applets
      you use, you made need quite a few more.
     </para>
     <para>
      To increase the number of shared segments with kernel 2.2, you have
      to increase the <varname>_SHM_ID_BITS</varname> variable in
      <filename class="headerfile">/usr/src/linux/include/asm/shmparam.h</filename>.
      The number of shared memory segments is 2 raised to the power of
      <varname>_SHM_ID_BITS</varname>.  Thus, 7 corresponds to 128,
      8 to 256, 9 to 512, and 10 to 1024.  You will then need to
      rebuild your kernel and reboot for the change to become active.

         It is (remotely) possible that you are trying to install 
         binaries for a newer version of your distribution on an old 
         machine, where "old" means "running a 2.0 Linux kernel and 
         a similarly old glibc". This won't work. If you have Red Hat 
         5.2, for example, you need to find or build rpms for that and 
         not to try to install rpms for 6.2. This applies similarly to 
         SuSE.

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         It is more likely to be problems with the permissions of the
         files which involve ptys. In particular, check the permissions
         of <filename>/dev/ptmx</filename>. They <emphasis>should</emphasis>
         be 666 (or crw-rw-rw when you do <command>ls -l /dev/ptmx</command>).
         If they aren't, change it with 
         <command>chmod 666 /dev/ptmx</command> (as root). You will find
         more about this in
         <filename>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/general/Changes</filename>.

       This is an annoying bug that results from panels announcing they
       exist, and dying in unusual ways that stop them saying they are
       dying. The fix is to upgrade to a recent gnome-core. If this does
       not work, a quick and dirty fix is to delete your 
       <filename class=directory>~/.gnome/</filename> directory. This is
       a nasty hack which fixes only the symptoms and not the cause of the
       problem, and it will lose any and all settings and changes to those
       settings which you have made to your GNOME desktop.

       <application>esound</application> is weird: I can get sound out of

       <application>xmms</application> won't play.
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
       GNOME expects all noises to go through <application>esound</application>,
       which talks directly to your sound card. <application>xmms</application>
       has different plugins for outputting sound. Right-click on 
       <application>xmms</application> and then on <guimenu>Options</guimenu>
       to bring up the <guilabel>Preferences</guilabel> dialogue box. Where
       it says <guilabel>Output Plugin</guilabel>, look at what is selected.
       If OSS Driver is selected, xmms is trying to talk directly to the
       soundcard, seeing that it is in use (because <application>esound</application>
       is talking to the soundcard), and xmms is waiting politely for esound to 
       stop using the soundcard. So nothing happens. Tell xmms to use esound 
       in the Output Plugin box, and your music should happen again.
     </para>
     <para>
       Problems with sound in general are sometimes due to the sound

       When GNOME starts, it wants to know the network address of the

       asking until it times out after a minute or so. If you are
       experiencing this problem, look at the file called
       <filename>/etc/hosts</filename>. There should be a line about
       the IP address 127.0.0.1 and it should say this:
       <literallayout>
127.0.0.1	localhost	localhost.localdomain
       </literallayout>
       If you have tried to put your machine's name into this line,
