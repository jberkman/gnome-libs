   Many of the trickier problems you may meet in <acronym>GNOME</acronym>
   are in fact <application>X</application>. This often means that fixing
   them will involve editing text files instead of using the GNOME tools.
   For now, at least.

    <question>

       Everything is HUGE!
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
       <application>X</application> can run at different resolutions.
       When it is first configured, the various programs to configure
       X (<application>Xconfigurator</application>, 
       <application>XF86Setup</application>, <application>SaX</application>
       and so on) will look at video card details and pick "safe" 
       resolutions, which are generally low. Often they will pick a 
       variety. If you have a low resolution, you can try experimenting with
       <keycombo>
        <keycap>control</keycap>
        <keycap>alt</keycap>
        <keycap>+</keycap>
       </keycombo> and
       <keycombo>
        <keycap>control</keycap>
        <keycap>alt</keycap>
        <keycap>-</keycap>
       </keycombo>
       (NB: these refer to <keycap>+</keycap> and <keycap>-</keycap> on the
       numberpad pad of the keyboard) to cycle through other available 
       resolutions. If not a lot happens, and you are confident that your 
       monitor and card can handle it, you can re-run the setup tool of your 
       choice for X and feed it different values, or <emphasis>if you know 
       what you're doing</emphasis> you can attempt to edit the 
       <filename>XF86Config</filename> which holds the relevant values 
       yourself. Editing this is not the recommended first tactic: if you 
       must try it, take a backup copy of the file first.
     </para>
     <para>
       If you are still stuck with 640x480 or 800x600 and one of the 
       huge things is the panel, you have a couple of options. First,
       you can use the arrows at the end of it and tidy it away when 
       you don't need it. Or you can use the autohide feature so that
       it hides mostly offscreen until you move the mouse over it. If
       you are using gnome-core-1.1.x or gnome-core-1.2.x, then there is
       also an option to shrink the width of the panel, available by
       right-clicking on the panel and following
       <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>Panel</guimenu>
        <guisubmenu>Properties</guisubmenu>
        <guisubmenu>Size</guisubmenu>
       </menuchoice>
       and picking <guimenuitem>Small</guimenuitem> or
       <guimenuitem>Tiny</guimenuitem>.
     </para>
     <para>
       If applications habitually open so large that they go off the
       edge of the screen, you should be able to resize them with your
       window manager before closing. On re-opening, applications which
       are session-managed by GNOME should re-open at the new size. If you
       can't get to parts of the application, your window manager probably
       has a way to move the window about without using the titlebar of
       the window. For <application>WindowMaker</application> and
       <application>Enlightenment</application>, the default way to do
       this is to hold the <keycap>alt</keycap> button down, and then
       move it with <mousebutton>mouse button 2</mousebutton> (the middle
       button). For <application>Sawfish</application>, it's the same
       but <mousebutton>mouse button 1</mousebutton> (the left button).

       There is a specific problem with <application>Netscape</application>

       This is an annoying bug that results from panels announcing they
       exist, and dying in unusual ways that stop them saying they are
       dying. The fix is to upgrade to a recent gnome-core. If this does
       not work, a quick and dirty fix is to delete your 
       <filename class=directory>~/.gnome/</filename> directory. This is
       a nasty hack which fixes only the symptoms and not the cause of the
       problem, and it will lose any and all settings and changes to those
       settings which you have made to your GNOME desktop.

   <qandaentry id="esound-and-xmms">
    <question>
     <para>
       <application>esound</application> is weird: I can get sound out of
       GNOME: beeps and bings in menu selection and so on. But 
       <application>xmms</application> won't play.
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
       GNOME expects all noises to go through <application>esound</application>,
       which talks directly to your sound card. <application>xmms</application>
       has different plugins for outputting sound. Right-click on 
       <application>xmms</application> and then on <guimenu>Options</guimenu>
       to bring up the <guilabel>Preferences</guilabel> dialogue box. Where
       it says <guilabel>Output Plugin</guilabel>, look at what is selected.
       If OSS Driver is selected, xmms is trying to talk directly to the
       soundcard, seeing that it is in use (because <application>esound</application>
       is talking to the soundcard), and xmms is waiting politely for esound to 
       stop using the soundcard. So nothing happens. Tell xmms to use esound 
       in the Output Plugin box, and your music should happen again.

    <question>
     <para>
       GNOME takes ages to start and I get a message about "Could not

     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
       When GNOME starts, it wants to know the network address of the
       computer it's starting on. If it can't find out, it will keep
       asking until it times out after a minute or so. If you are
       experiencing this problem, look at the file called
       <filename>/etc/hosts</filename>. There should be a line about
       the IP address 127.0.0.1 and it should say this:
       <literallayout>
127.0.0.1	localhost	localhost.localdomain
       </literallayout>
       If you have tried to put your machine's name into this line,
       this may be the problem. <!-- FIXME: can someone confirm this? -->

    <question>
     <para>
       Everything else works, but I get a message about Unix98 ptys when
       trying to start gnome-terminal.
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
       This refers to an option when compiling a Linux kernel. The 2.0
       series do not have it on. The 2.2 series does. If you have recompiled
       your kernel yourself, check you did enable the Unix98 ptys option in
       the process. If you haven't touched your kernel, it is possible that
       you are trying to install binaries for a newer version of your
       distribution on an old machine. This won't work. If you have 
       Red Hat 5.2, for example, you need to find rpms for that and not
       to try to install rpms for 6.2. This applies similarly to SuSE.

       Cool! Please take a few minutes to investigate and then send it in.
       If you have an oldish package, it is worth checking the announcements
       for newer packages to see whether it's been fixed. If it hasn't been
       fixed or mentioned and you can't find it by searching the 
       <ulink type="http" url="http://bugs.gnome.org">bug tracker</ulink>,
       then start off <application>bug-buddy</application> from the main menu
       with
       <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>Programs</guimenu>
        <guisubmenu>Utilities</guisubmenu>
        <guimenuitem>Bug report tool</guimenuitem>
