      What's this X thing then?

    <para>
      X, the X-Window System, X11 (but never <quote>X-Windows</quote>)
      is what GNOME sits on top of. It has absolutely nothing to do with
      Microsoft Windows, and if you try to think of it as a version of
      that, then you will get confused.

    <para>
      X is a open standard understood by many operating systems. It is
      available on all versions of UNIX, on OS/2, and on VMS (but not on
      Microsoft Windows.) It is used for drawing a graphical display on 
      your computer; and it is used for networking. Sometimes it's easier 
      to think of it as a networking tool which happens to draw pictures.
    </para>
    <para>
      The reason this matters in a GNOME FAQ is that GNOME sits on
      top of X. You need X on your computer and working properly for
      GNOME to work. Sometimes things you may think are related to
      GNOME are in fact related to X: for example, some (but not all)
      font issues are related to X; the resolution of your screen is
      handled by X; and it's the contents of your X configuration file
      which tells X how to start GNOME.

      Networking? Why does this matter?
    </para>   
   </question>
   <answer>   
    <para>      
      Networking matters in X because it's part of what it was designed
      to do. If you have two connected machines, it's possible (and
      extremely simple) to sit at one machine and tell it to run the
      X server on the other machine but display it where you're sitting.
      Yes, this means that GNOME can do this too. Whilst you are using
      GNOME, you can also connect to other machines you have access to,
      and start GNOME programs there, and the results will be displayed
      on your machine.

   <question> 
    <para>                        
      Where do window managers come into all this? What is a 
      "GNOME-compliant" window manager and do I need one?
    </para>   
   </question>
   <answer>   
    <para>      
      The window manager is what decides how to display and move
      windows about. X gives you the ability to have windows on your
      screen. The window manager is what controls how they appear, how
      how move them about, and what the borders of the window look like.
      There are many many window managers out there.
    </para> 
    <para>
      GNOME doesn't require you to use any one particular window manager
      and has no one "official" window manager. But you will get the most 
      out of GNOME if you use a GNOME-compliant one.
      A GNOME-compliant window manager is one which co-operates with
      GNOME and understands information that GNOME sends the window
      manager. Fully or largely GNOME-compliant window managers include

      Previous versions of this FAQ also referred to a few more as
      putting the finishing touches to GNOME-compliancy: of these, the FAQs for
      <ulink type="http" url="http://www.fvwm.org">FVWM</ulink> and 
      <ulink type="http" url="http://www-masuda.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~kourai/qvwm/qvwm-e.html">Qvwm</ulink>
      do not mention GNOME (comments from users of these with GNOME welcome!),
      and the 
      <ulink type="http" url="http://www.afterstep.org">AfterStep</ulink>
      FAQ refers to being as GNOME-compliant as possible but prefers the
      AfterStep pager to those offered by GNOME.
    </para>
    <para>
      From a practical point of view, picking one of the definitely
      GNOME-compliant window managers is a good idea simply because
      most GNOME users and developers use them and you are more likely
      to get rapid answers from them due to familiarity. The currently
      in-vogue window managers appear to be 
      <application>Enlightenment</application>, which was the first to
      be designed to be compliant, and 
      <application>Sawfish</application>, which is designed specifically
      to be light-weight and to work with GNOME. A resolute minority prefer 
      the older but still popular
      <application>Window Maker</application> and
      <application>FVWM</application>.
