      What's this X thing then?

    <para>
      X, the X-Window System, X11 (but the manual page asks you not to
      call it <quote>X-Windows</quote>) is what GNOME sits on top of. 
      The <quote>Window</quote> part of the name is not associated with
      the MS Windows operating system: don't get confused by that!

      <!-- This paragraph is from John Kodis. -->
      The X Window System is a open standard understood by many
      operating systems.  It is used for drawing a graphical display
      on your computer.  X is the native windowing system on all
      versions of UNIX and VMS.  X servers are also available for
      Microsoft Windows and OS/2, even though these operating systems
      have their own proprietary windowing systems.  X also allows an
      application running on one computer to display its output on
      another remote computer.  Sometimes it's easier to think of X
      as a networking tool which happens to draw pictures.
    </para>
    <para>
      The reason this matters in a GNOME FAQ is that GNOME sits on
      top of X. You need X on your computer and working properly for
      GNOME to work. Sometimes things you may think are related to
      GNOME are in fact related to X: for example, some (but not all)
      font issues are related to X; the resolution of your screen is
      handled by X; and it's the contents of your X configuration file
      which tells X how to start GNOME.

   <question> 
    <para>                        
      Networking? Why does this matter?
    </para>   
   </question>
   <answer>   
    <para>      
      Networking matters in X because it's part of what it was designed
      to do. If you have two connected machines, it's possible (and
      extremely simple) to sit at one machine and tell it to run the
      X server (which handles the display) on your machine, but to run
      X clients (the programs you actually see) from the other machine.
      So you can run the other machine's programs without moving to
      that other machine, which may be in the next room or miles away.
      Yes, this means that GNOME can do this too. Whilst you are using
      GNOME, you can also connect to other machines you have access to,
      and start GNOME programs there, and the results will be displayed
      on your machine.

   <question> 
    <para>                        
      Where do window managers come into all this? What is a 
      "GNOME-compliant" window manager and do I need one?
    </para>   
   </question>
   <answer>   
    <para>      
      The window manager is what decides how to display and move
      windows about. X gives you the ability to have windows on your
      screen. The window manager is what controls how they appear, how
      how move them about, and what the borders of the window look like.
      There are many many window managers out there.
    </para> 
    <para>
      GNOME doesn't require you to use any one particular window manager
      and has no one "official" window manager. But you will get the most 
      out of GNOME if you use a GNOME-compliant one.
      A GNOME-compliant window manager is one which co-operates with
      GNOME and understands information that GNOME sends the window
      manager. Fully or largely GNOME-compliant window managers include

      Previous versions of this FAQ also referred to a few more as
      putting the finishing touches to GNOME-compliancy: of these, the 
      FAQ for 
      <ulink type="http" url="http://www-masuda.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~kourai/qvwm/qvwm-e.html">Qvwm</ulink>
      does not mention GNOME; and the 
      <ulink type="http" url="http://www.afterstep.org">AfterStep</ulink>
      FAQ refers to being as GNOME-compliant as possible but prefers the
      AfterStep pager to those offered by GNOME. (Comments from users
      of these welcomed.) 
    </para>
    <para>
      From a practical point of view, picking one of the definitely
      GNOME-compliant window managers is a good idea simply because
      most GNOME users and developers use them and you are more likely
      to get rapid answers from them due to familiarity. The currently
      in-vogue window managers appear to be 
      <application>Sawfish</application>, which is specifically designed
      to work with GNOME, and
      <application>Enlightenment</application>, which was the first to
      be designed to be compliant and was widely shipped with GNOME.
      A resolute minority prefer the older but still popular
      <application>Window Maker</application> and
      <application>FVWM</application> window managers.
