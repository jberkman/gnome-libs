      So what is <acronym>GNOME</acronym>?

      The initials stand for GNU Network Object Model Environment.
      This doesn't really help explain what it does, though.
      <acronym>GNOME</acronym> is a part of the 
      <ulink type="http" url="http://www.gnu.org">GNU Project</ulink> and 
      an attempt to make a desktop environment which is

    <para>      
      In English, the word "gnome" is pronounced with a silent "g".
      However, <acronym>GNOME</acronym> itself is generally pronounced
      as "guh-nome", just as <acronym>GNU</acronym> is pronounced
      "guh-noo" when referring to the <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org"

   <question> 
    <para>                        
      The version numbers are hard! Help!
    </para>   
   </question>
   <answer>   
    <para>      
      If you're not used to them, they're hard, yes. It doesn't help that
      people familiar with different releases will also use names for the
      releases as well as or instead of the version numbers.
    </para> 
    <para>
      <acronym>GNOME</acronym> uses a version number system that is very
      common on the net now: it's also used by the Linux kernel, the mutt
      mailer, and several other large applications. It's three numbers
      separated by dots, in an x.y.z format. Start with the first number.
      If it is 0, the app is probably still in development: it may be
      stable, but it may not have all the features planned yet. If it's
      1 then look at the second number. Odd numbers mean it's unstable,
      at least nominally, or a development version. Even numbers (or zero) 
      mean it's stable. So the gnome-core-1.1.z packages were unstable.
      When they became stable, they were released as gnome-core-1.2.0.
      The third number is simply a minor increment, denoting bug-fixes
      or small improvements. Note that it is not a decimal number. When you 
      get to 1.1.9 in a package, the next number is quite likely to be 1.1.10. 
    </para>
    <para>
      Most GNOME packages seem to come out with memorable names: 
      the October GNOME release, "Beantown" for gnome-core-1.1.1 and so
      on. The reason why so many releases of GNOME packages have inventive
      names may either be an attempt to make the packages more memorable,
      or they may be a reflection on the minds of the developers.

    <para>
      <acronym>GNOME</acronym> is under the control of no one company.
      There are hundreds of people working on it all over the world. Some
      are doing it for free, some are doing it in addition to their day job,
      and some are doing it as their day job, funded by their company. So
      <acronym>GNOME</acronym> itself isn't an entity which is going to 
      have an <acronym>IPO</acronym>. Several companies are making
      significant contributions to the Gnome project, and we wish them

   <question> 
    <para>                        
      There's GNOME and KDE. Why two environments? Why not merge them?
    </para>   
   </question>
   <answer>   
    <para>      
      There are several answers to this. First, there is the issue of 
      licensing. This is a big issue in the world of free software and 
      can lead to equally big arguments. The
      <ulink type="http" url="http://www.kde.org">KDE Project</ulink>
      came first, and used a set of libraries called Qt. These had a
      non-free licence. Some people didn't like this licence and wanted
      to work on something with a different licence, so looked about, 
      found none, and wrote their own, which are under the GPL and the
      LGPL. Qt's licence has changed since then and is now also GPL for
      the Linux and Unix platforms. But by the time this happened, the 
      projects had diverged greatly in look, focus, organisation, and 
      how the code underneath worked.
    </para> 
    <para>
      Second, although they look very similar on top, the way each works
      underneath is very different. You couldn't just take code from one
      project and plug it into the other. It's not that simple. You can
      run some KDE programs from within GNOME and vice versa, but making
      them work any more closely is hard.
    </para>
    <para>
      Finally, it's worth pointing out that whilst the code in the two
      projects can't work together, this is not necessarily true of the 
      developers. GNOME developers and KDE developers do actually talk to 
      each other. It's even rumoured that some of them get on quite well.
