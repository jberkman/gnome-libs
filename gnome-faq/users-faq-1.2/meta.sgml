  <title>History</title>
  <para>
    The GNOME FAQ version 1.0.7 came out in late 1999. It was 
    copyrighted to Todd Lewis, Gleef (David Zoll), Miguel de Icaza and
    Rasaki Bidem Bolante Temidire. It was released under the GNU GPL.
    It's still in CVS if anyone prefers it to this.
  </para>
  <para>
    Parts of it needed updating and augmenting, but it proved impossible
    to contact any of the copyright holders to let them know other than
    Miguel. Rather than mutilate their work beyond what they might
    have expected, both in the content and in the DocBook used, I (Telsa) 
    simply started over, and used the GNU Free Documentation Licence because 
    it was now out and the Gnome Documentation Project likes it. 
  </para>
  <para>
    The current maintainer is actually Julian ("x-virge") Missig.

    If you have suggestions for the FAQ, whether they are more questions,
    better answers, typo corrections or URL updates, please send them
    to <email>gnomefaq@gnu.org</email>. Note that this is <emphasis>not</emphasis>
    a <application>GNOME</application> support address. It's an address which
    redirects to a number of people. The people reading it cannot respond to 
    individual questions, especially when they're already answered in the FAQ.
    New answers and updates to what's currently in the FAQ would be 
    particularly appreciated. Since most of the FAQ people use Red Hat or
    Debian, answers which apply to other Linux distros, to *BSD, or other
    UNIXes would be particularly appreciated.

    You can now also use the new <ulink type="http" 
    url="http://bugzilla.gnome.org">Gnome bug tracker</ulink> for the FAQ:
    it is in the product <quote>gnome-user-docs</quote> and the component
    is of course <quote>user-faq</quote>.
