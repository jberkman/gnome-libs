   <question>
    <para>
      When I boot Linux up, I start at a text prompt. How do I start
      GNOME?
    </para>
   </question>
   <answer>
    <para>
      With luck, you should be able to type <command>startx</command> to
      start <application>X</application> and <application>GNOME</application>
      will start up. If you're looking here, though, it probably means
      this didn't work. The solution will depend on the exact problem and
      on the distribution you are using. 
    </para>
    <para>
      If the problem is that <application>X</application> starts but
      you get something other than <application>GNOME</application>
      on top of it, some distributions have tools that let you avoid
      editing text files yourself:

      <term>Red Hat and Mandrake</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         Red Hat Linux and Linux Mandrake both come with an application
         called <application>switchdesk</application>. This can be 
         started within <application>X</application> or run from outside
         it and lets you alter your desktop between 
         <application>GNOME</application>,
         <application>KDE</application> and (on Red Hat)
         <application>AfterStep</application>. Nice and simple.

      <term>SuSE</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         SuSE Linux uses <application>YaST</application> to configure
         <application>X</application> and what happens when you
         start it. You should be able to tell it to start
         <application>GNOME</application> as the <quote>window manager</quote>
         when you start <application>X</application>. (Yes, confusing
         terminology.) 
       </para>
       <para>
         On SuSE, you should also simply be able to type
         <command>startx gnome</command> to start <application>GNOME</application>
         up.

     </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
    <para>
      If you have one of the above Linux distributions, use the method
      listed above. If not, then you will need to look at the following:
    </para>
    <para>
      If the problem is that <application>X</application> starts up but
      either <application>KDE</application> starts or neither 
      <application>KDE</application> nor <application>GNOME</application>
      start, then look for a file called <filename>.xinitrc</filename> or
      (possibly) <filename>.Xclients</filename> in your home directory. Edit 
      it with a text editor. If you don't have a favourite editor yet, 
      friendly editors for new users are <application>pico</application> 
      (comes with a help screen switched on) and <application>joe</application>
      (if you like the old Wordstar keys, you'll like this). You want to 
      remove everything from it and end up with just this in it: 
      <command>exec gnome-session</command>.
      Save this file, and then retry <command>startx</command>. 
    </para>
    <para>
      If the problem is that either you see a great mass of scrolling
      messages and then you get your prompt back with an error message,
      or that the screen clears and then nothing more happens, then you
      have problems with your X configuration. This is beyond the scope of
      this FAQ, but first steps to fixing it are to become root and
      re-run your X configuration tool.

      I want GNOME to start when I boot Linux up. How do I do this?
    </para>   
   </question>
   <answer>   
    <para>      
      The old answer to this used to be to edit the file called
      <filename>/etc/inittab</filename>, which contains the list of
      what to start when as the machine boots. However, this has
      become more complicated because it involves setting up the
      correct display manager (of <application>xdm</application>,
      <application>kdm</application> and <application>gdm</application>).
      Foolproof answers to this question which work for different
      flavours of Linux are solicited eagerly.

      It starts. Now what?

   </question>
   <answer>   
    <para>      
      Well, what do you want to do? You will find almost everything
      by clicking on the <guimenu>GNOME menu</guimenu> which generally
      appears as a G-shaped footprint with a small arrow next to it to
      indicate that it's a menu. Clicking on some of the other things on
      the panel will also make things happen. If you run out of things
      to click, you can poke around further by right-clicking on the
      panel, too.
