      What is the command line equivalent to &lt;application&gt; on the menu?

   <answer>
    <para>
     You will often find the name of the program in the 
     <guilabel>About box</guilabel> of the program. If not, use the
     menu editor, available from
     <menuchoice>
      <guimenu>Programs</guimenu>
      <guisubmenu>Settings</guisubmenu>
      <guimenuitem>Menu editor</guimenuitem>
     </menuchoice>. The command line equivalent is that contained in
     the <guilabel>Command</guilabel> box.

    <para>      
      Right-clicking on the application in question will give you an option
      of <guimenuitem>Properties</guimenuitem> in the menu which appears.
      Looking at that will tell you the command to start it from a terminal.

        If you don't usually use the applets or applications which
        start automatically when you start GNOME (deskguide, clock,
        help browser, file manager), then get rid of them. In the
        control center you will find a section called 
        <guilabel>Startup Programs</guilabel>. You can attempt to 
        identify the ones you don't need by picking them from the list
        of <guibutton>Browse running sessions</guibutton> and clicking
        on <guibutton>Remove</guibutton>. Don't remove gnome-smproxy,
        panel, or gmc, unless you know what you're doing. If this is too
        complicated, you can also simply press the "kill button" on the
        apps which started (typically the help browser and the file
        manager), or right-click on applets and select 
        <guimenuitem>Remove</guimenuitem>, and then remember to save the
        session when you log out.

        If you use themes, don't use pixmap themes. Pixmap themes are the
        ones which have a lot more detail, background which is shaded in
        varying colours, or lots of pictures in them. Some of them can
        be very heavy on a slow machine because they are more complicated
        to draw. Engine themes (non-pixmap) themes include, gtkstep (the
        default), metal, notif, redmond95, thinice, clean and xenophelia.

        users to be generally very light and zippy, as is Enlightenment if
        you turn all the fancy options off. If you don't want to change
        your window manager, have a look at the options for
        the window manager itself, and turn off anything that needs a lot
        of effort to redraw: complicated pictures, animations, transparent
        window moving. If you use window manager themes, again, pick a
        simple one. For moving and resizing, a light option is "boxed".

  <qandaentry id="memory-use">
   <question>
    <para>
      I looked at the memory used by <application>GNOME</application>. It
      uses loads, and even killing things off doesn't free it up! Help!
    </para>
   </question>
   <answer>
    <para>
      This is not a bug. This is standard UNIX behaviour. You have been
      using the monitor applets or <application>gtop</application>, right?
      And looking at "Mem" or some similar title? You don't want that. For
      a start, most of that total is from shared libraries. Further to that,
      UNIX keeps information from programs in memory for a while after
      they have been killed, in case they are needed again. If 
      something else is started and needs that space, that's when it gets
      rid of it. In addition, you are probably looking at the wrong sort
      of memory :) 
    </para>
    <para>
      There is an excellent document on memory use in GNOME
      and in UNIX which explains about shared libraries and their uses and
      how to work out how much memory something is <emphasis>really</emphasis>
      using which lives in GNOME CVS. You can browse it at <ulink type="http"
      url="http://cvs.gnome.org/lxr/source/white-papers/MemoryUsage/MemoryUsage.txt">
      http://cvs.gnome.org/lxr/source/white-papers/MemoryUsage/MemoryUsage.txt</ulink>.
    </para>
    <para>
      It's probably worth mentioning that there are one or two applications
      notorious for eating memory, both within and without GNOME. One common
      example is leaving <application>Netscape</application> open for a
      long time. Changing themes over and over again in the clock applets 
      has been known to have a similar effect. Solution: don't cycle 
      through the themes madly, and if you can reliably reproduce a
      memory leak, please submit a bug report.

  <qandaentry id="middle-clicking">
   <question>
    <para>
      I have a two-button mouse. What's this "middle-click"? 
    </para>
   </question>
   <answer>
    <para>
      X has long assumed that mice have many buttons (it can cope with 
      at least five). You don't normally need more than three, although
      <application>Quake</application> players may disagree. To simulate
      a middle-click on your two-button mouse with XFree86, try "chording": 
      click both buttons simultaneously. This should work. If it does not, 
      you may have to edit your XF86Config file (make a backup copy of it 
      first. This is not a file to make mistakes in). to ensure there are 
      uncommented lines which say "Emulate3Buttons" and 
      "Emulate3Timeout 50". A commented line has a hash (<keycap>#</keycap>) 
      symbol at the start of either line. To uncomment the line, remove the
      hash sign from the start of the line. You will need to restart X for 
      this to take effect.
    </para>
    <para>
      Commercial and proprietary versions of X may differ: an example
      is that this is set in the Exceed version of X by selecting
      <guibutton>middle button emulation</guibutton> in the
      <guilabel>input configuration</guilabel> dialog box.

  <qandaentry id="disable-root-warning">
   <question>
    <para>
      How do I disable that annoying "Warning! You are running as root!"
      message? 
    </para>
   </question>
   <answer>
    <para>
      Just get an up-to-date copy of the code in question, investigate
      what generates the message, tweak the code to remove it, recompile it, 
      and you're done.
    </para>
    <para>
      If that doesn't look helpful, then it's because it's not meant to
      be. That warning is there for a reason. Running as root should be
      reserved for system administration tasks only, and this does not
      include recataloguing your jpgs, chatting on IRC, or playing with
      Napster. It's a security risk, and it's very easy to have accidents
      as root and remove things you didn't mean to. Running as a normal
      user is safer and more sensible. It is assumed that people who can
      remove the message are the people who won't normally be running as
      root in the first place.

  <qandaentry id="running-root-progs">
   <question>
    <para>
      But then how can I run <command>helix-update</command>,
      <command>gnome-linuxconf</command>, the menu-editor, or programs which
      monitor logfiles that root can read and my normal user can't?
    </para>
   </question>
   <answer>
    <para>
      As your normal user, open a gnome-terminal. Type <command>su -</command>
      and give the password. That is now a root shell where you can run
      such commands by typing them at the command line.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you make a lot of use of this, you should consider installing
      the package called <application>sudo</application>, which allows 
      you to let non-root users do root things under tight controls. 
    </para>
    <para>
      Note that you can run <command>helix-update</command> without
      being root if you are using a recent (post-May 2000) version of it on
      Red Hat, Linux Mandrake, TurboLinux, or LinuxPPC. Run it as a
      user, and it will prompt you for the root password.
