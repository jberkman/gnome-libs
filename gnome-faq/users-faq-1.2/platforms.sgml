    <para>
      What does GNOME run on?
    </para>
   </question>
   <answer>
    <para>
      GNOME can be probably be persuaded to run on any platform that
      is UNIX-like and supports X, the X-Windowing System. 
    </para>
    <para>
      GNOME will certainly run on almost any recent distribution of
      Linux. It runs on FreeBSD. It runs on NetBSD. It runs on Solaris.
      There are enough users of it on these platforms for you to be
      able to find information on this relatively easily. It has also
      been reported to run on OpenBSD, IRIX, HP-UX and AIX. More
      esoterically, it's rumoured that it runs on Linux on the S/390..

   <answer>
    <para>
      GNOME does not run on any form of Microsoft Windows. It doesn't
      run on BeOS or MacOS. It doesn't run on eCos, the embedded 
      operating system. A port to OS/2 was begun, but the status of
      this is unknown. (Updates welcomed.)

      When will it run on my favourite operating system?
    </para>
   </question>
   <answer>
    <para>
      When someone ports it and everything it needs to run onto that
      operating system. This will largely be when someone gets interested
      enough to do it.

   <question>
    <para>
      Who supports GNOME?
    </para>
   </question>
   <answer>
    <para>
      There is a large and very active community of GNOME developers and
      users who write, fix, update, document, tweak and translate GNOME for
      free, although they have been known to accept someone buying them
      a drink for their pains. Many GNOME users are only too willing to
      help new folks with it. 
    </para>
    <para>
      Various commercial Linux distributions offer support for GNOME. 
      There is an increasing number of free software consultancy companies
      and of support companies, many of which support GNOME. An up to 
      date list may be found on the
