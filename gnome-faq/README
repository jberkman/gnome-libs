As of May 26th 2000, this directory was in a bit of a mess.

The original FAQ was gnome-faq.sgml, which had been split into 
devel-faq.sgml and users-faq.sgml. I updated the users' FAQ and
put my version of it into users-faq-1.2/. 

`db2html users-faq.sgml' should include all the relevant files when 
it builds. If you add new questions, please use the id tags in the 
<qandaentry>, and please check there are no jade errors _before_ 
committing. (Please?).
