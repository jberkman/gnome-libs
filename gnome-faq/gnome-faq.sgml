  <chapter id="Overview">
    <title>GNOME Overview</title>
      
    <para>This section covers questions that pertain to GNOME as
    a whole.</para>

    <sect1>
      <title>What does GNOME stand for?</title>

      <para>GNOME stands for "GNU Network Object Model
      Environment". GNU stands for "GNU's Not Unix".</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1>
      <title>What is GNOME?</title>
	
      <para>To quote from the original announcement from
      comp.os.linux.announce, GNOME is intended to be "a free and
      complete set of user friendly applications and desktop tools,
      similar to CDE and KDE but based entirely on free
      software."</para>

      <para>I, your lowly FAQ maintainer, like to explain GNOME as
      everything that's expected in a modern programming
      environment. In this respect, it is approximately equivalent to
      CDE, Win32, NextStep, or KDE. The big difference is that, unlike
      any of the above-mentioned examples, every single component of
      GNOME is "Free" or "Open Source" software.</para>

      <para>For the project geographers out there, here are some of
      the higher mountains to be found in GNOME-land:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>GNOME uses the Object Management Group's Common Object
	  Request Broker Architecture to allow software components to
	  inter-operate seamlessly, regardless of the language in which
	  they are implemented, or even what machine they are running
	  on! (See <link linkend="CORBA">CORBA</link>)</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The GNOME community is working hard on developing an
	  object model called baboon. Based on CORBA and similar to
	  Microsoft's Object Linking and Embedding, v2 (OLE2), baboon
	  will allow programmers to export and/or import componentized
	  resources. This, for example, would allow users to use
	  whatever editor they like in their development environment,
	  provided that their editor supported via CORBA a
	  standardized editor interface (See <link
	  linkend="BABOON">BABOON</link>)</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>GNOME is not tied to any one window manager. You can
	  chose your favorite window manager and use it with
	  GNOME. (See <link linkend="WM">Window Manager</link>)</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>GNOME uses the Gimp Tool Kit (GTK+) as the graphics
	  toolkit for all graphical applications. GTK+ has tons of
	  neat features, but my three favs are: (1) support for
	  multiple languages, including C, C++, Objective-C, Scheme,
	  Perl, and others; (2) themability, where a user can change
	  the look and feel of all GTK+ apps on a machine while apps
	  are running, which is just unbelievably cool; (3) and
	  finally, GTK+ is licensed under the LGPL, meaning that it is
	  completely open source(TM), or "free" software, just like
	  the rest of GNOME. (See <link
	  linkend="GTK">GTK+</link>)</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Along with GTK+, GNOME uses Imlib, an image library
	  for the X Window System which supports multiple image
	  formats, from XPM to PNG, and multiple bit-depths, from
	  24-bit True Color down to 1-bit Black and White, all
	  transparently to the programmer. (See <link
	  linkend="IMLIB">Imlib</link>)</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>All GNOME applications are session aware. This means,
	  e.g., that if you shut down the GNOME word processor and
	  then start it back up again, it will open up the document
	  which you had open before, and put your cursor back at the
	  same place. This is accomplished via the X Session
	  Management system, as implemented in the GNOME Session
	  Manager. (See <link linkend="SM">Session
	  Management</link>)</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>GNOME uses of the DocBook SGML standard for all
	  documentation, which allows programmers to write
	  documentation in a straightforward way. Documentation can
	  then be viewed with the GNOME help browser, or rendered into
	  HTML and viewed with a web browser, or converted into LaTeX
	  or postscript and printed out. (See <link
	  linkend="SGML">SGML</link>)</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>GNOME supports the Uniforum standard
	  internationalization and localization methods, allowing
	  support for new languages to be added without even requiring
	  a recompile of the application. (See <link
	  linkend="I18N">Internationalization &
	  Localization</link>)</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>GNOME applications will support several Drag and Drop
	  protocols for maximum interoperability with other
	  applications. (See <link linkend="XDND">Drag and
	  Drop</link>)</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>GNOME will support 3D programming with OpenGL,
	  allowing people to use 3-dimensional graphics right in their
	  GNOME apps, whether they be scientific applications or
	  games. GNOME uses Mesa, which is an open source
	  implementation of the OpenGL standard. (See <link
	  linkend="OPENGL">OpenGL</link>)</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>If all of this seems ambitious, that's because it is! Read
      on to find out more!</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1>
      <title>Where can I find more information, help, or tips on about
      GNOME?</title>

      <para>The GNOME home page is, of course a good place to start:
      <ulink url="&wwwgnome;">&wwwgnome;</ulink>.</para>

      <para>You also should consider joining the gnome-list mailing
      list, it is a very good place to ask for help.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="MailingList">
      <title>How do I use these GNOME mailing lists I keep hearing
      about?</title>

      <para>The best place for up-to-date help and information on
      GNOME is the mailing lists.  You can find them listed at <ulink
      url="&wwwgnomelist;">&wwwgnomelist;</ulink>.  The
      general-purpose list for help and discussion is <ulink
      url="&mailrequest;">gnome-list@gnome.org</ulink>.  To join this
      (or any) of the lists, send email to the <emphasis>request
      address</emphasis>, this is generally the list address with
      "-request" added to the name.  For example the request list for
      gnome-list is <ulink url="mailto:&mailrequest;">
      &mailrequest;</ulink>.  The subject of the email
      <emphasis>must</emphasis> be
      <userinput>subscribe</userinput>.</para>

      <para>Within a few minutes (possibly a little longer if you
      aren't in North America), you should get an automatic reply
      back asking for confirmation.  Follow the directions in this
      email, and you will be subscribed.  Finally, the system will
      send you two emails with help on how to use the system.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="Archives">
      <title>How do I get to the mailing list archives?</title>

      <para>There are two ways.  The easiest is to go to the mailing
      list page at <ulink url="&wwwgnomelist;">&wwwgnomelist;</ulink>.
      Click on any of the list addresses on the left, you will be able
      to browse the archives of that list.</para>

      <para>If you need to search the archives, you can use the
      request address for that list.  One of the emails it sent you
      when you first subscribed gives instructions on how to do this.
      If you have lost those instructions, email <ulink
      url="&mailrequest;">gnome-list-request@gnome.org</ulink> with a
      subject of <userinput>archive help</userinput>.  It will reply
      with instructions on how to use the archive system.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="Pronunciation">
      <title>How do I pronounce GNOME?</title>

      <para>GNOME stands for <quote>GNU Network Object Model
      Environment</quote>.  GNU stands for <quote>GNU's Not
      Unix</quote>, and has always been officially pronounced
      <quote>guh-NEW</quote> to minimize confusion.  Since GNU is
      GNOME's first name, GNOME is officially pronounced
      <quote>guh-NOME</quote>.</para>

      <para>However, many people pronounce GNOME as just
      <quote>NOME</quote> (like those short people from legend),
      nobody will hurt you if you find this pronunciation
      easier.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="WhyGNOME">
      <title>Why GNOME?</title>

      <para>First, GNOME is a completely open source programming
      environment, which makes it easy for people to write good
      programs for GNOME systems.</para>

      <para>The second goal, by way of the first goal, is that people
      who use Unix operating systems will have a nice user environment
      in which to work. This goal has its origins in the goal of the
      Linux project, which is, in the words of Linus Torvalds, "World
      Domination". In the true spirit of brotherhood, however, GNOME
      is not a Linux-only project; again, the designers intend for
      every part of GNOME to be able to run on modern Unix-like
      systems.</para>

      <para>Finally, GNOME has a lot of really neat features that
      geeks are guaranteed to enjoy. Says one reviewer of this
      FAQ:</para>
      <blockquote>
	<para>Todd, GNOME has technical merits even beyond "open
	source" and "nice environment" and "world domination," as you
	well know...For instance, the COM clone and the use of CORBA
	for inter-operation gives me a woody.</para>
      </blockquote>

      <para>This is certainly true (the fact that GNOME has great
      technical merit; I have no knowledge on the woody front.) Try it
      out for yourself and see!</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="WhyNot">
      <title>Why not CDE? or KDE? or GNUStep?</title>

      <para>Because GNOME is better!  Seriously though, each of these
      desktop systems have issues which encouraged us to start fresh
      with the GNOME project.</para>

      <para>CDE is not Free Software, it isn't even close.  Many
      people also find it lacking in features, performance and
      functionality.</para>

      <para>At the time of GNOME's inception, KDE had serious
      licensing problems, which they are still trying to resolve. KDE
      is based on a commercial library called Qt, which has a very
      liberal license, but it is not <ulink url="&wwwgnufree;">Free
      Software</ulink>.  TrollTech has promised to change the Qt
      license, but they have not yet done so.  In addition there were
      compatibility problems between KDE's license and Qt's. Rather
      than dwell on this issue, you can read <ulink
      url="http://www.redhat.com/redhat/qtlicense.html">RedHat's
      position on KDE</ulink> and <ulink
      url="http://www.debian.org/News/1998/19981008">Debian's position
      on KDE</ulink>.  The GNOME people like the KDE people, and we
      consider this an unfortunate situation that is in the process of
      being fixed.  Hopefully, this will cease to be an issue soon,
      and GNOME and KDE can compete friendlily on technical merit and
      design.</para>

      <para>This matter has been hashed out time and time again on the
      gnome-list mailing list.  Asking this question on gnome-list is
      discouraged behavior. If you want to go somewhere and start a
      flame war on this topic, then please do it somewhere far far away
      where we don't have to listen to you.</para>

      <para>There are significant design differences between KDE and
      GNOME.  Top of the list is a difference in widget set.  We find
      GTK+ to be nicer, more customizable, more friendly to
      development in various languages, and more flexible than Qt;
      others may disagree.  In all, the projects are different enough
      so that both should be able to coexist and even
      collaborate.</para>

      <para>GNUStep is another desktop environment that has a lot of
      good things going for it.  One issue with GNUStep are that they
      are trying to reimplement the OpenStep desktop and API, with
      GNOME we'd rather develop something new and good rather than
      redo something old and good.  Also, just like Qt strongly pushes
      C++ on KDE developers, GNUStep strongly pushes Objective C on
      its developers.  GNOME wants to remain language agnostic, and
      support development in whatever language you wish to use.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1>
      <title>What platforms?</title>

      <para>GNOME was started by several people well-known in the
      Linux and GNU communities, but it is intended to run on any
      modern and functional Unix-like system. GNOME has been reported
      to work under the following:</para>
      <simplelist>
	<member>Linux</member>
	<member>BSD (FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD)</member>
	<member>Solaris</member>
	<member>IRIX</member>
	<member>HP-UX</member>
	<member>AIX</member>
	<member>probably some others; I have not really kept
	track. </member>
      </simplelist>

      <para>If you try GNOME on other platforms and it works, then
      please be sure to let me know so that I can include it here. If
      you try it on another platform and have trouble, then please
      report the difficulties which you encounter, so that the GNOME
      developers can work on the problem. (See Section on contacting
      the author.)</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1>
      <title>Can I still run my programs under GNOME?</title>

      <para>GNOME doesn't replace your system, it runs on top of it.
      All programs that run without GNOME should run fine alongside
      GNOME.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="WM">
      <title>What is a window manager, and what does it have to do with
      GNOME?</title>

      <para>A window manager is a program within the X Windows
      environment which controls the placement and appearance of
      windows on the screen.  Look at an xterm or something.  The box
      of terminal text is the actual xterm, the border, title bar,
      buttons and so forth are all handled by the window manager.
      Some window managers have extra features, but all handle window
      placement and decoration.</para>

      <para>There are many window managers out there, and GNOME should
      work well with all of them.  There are a few GNOME features
      (such as session management, and the GNOME pager), that won't
      work with all of them.  For best results, go with a
      GNOME-compliant window manager.  The two most compliant are
      currently Enlightenment and IceWM, with FVWM, SCWM, WindowMaker
      and QVWM putting finishing touches on GNOME-compliance as we
      speak.</para>

  <chapter id="GettingGNOME">
    <title>Getting GNOME</title>

    <para>There are many ways to get GNOME on your system.  This
    section covers the most common questions involved in the
    process.</para>

    <sect1 id="SystemRequirements">
      <title>What are the System Requirements for GNOME?</title>

      <para>Currently, you need a machine with Unix or a Unix-like
      operating system installed (this includes Linux and FreeBSD),
      with the X Window System (X11R5 or later).  You need at least
      16MB of RAM, although I expect you'll be happier with 32MB or
      more.  If you are just installing binaries, you need about 30MB
      of disk space, count on needing at least 200MB of disk space if
      you are compiling from source.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1>
      <title>What's the best format to get GNOME for my
      machine?</title>

      <para>It depends on what kind of computer you have, and what you
      want to do with GNOME.  If in doubt, the officially supported
      way to install GNOME is from the latest set of tarballs (the
      files ending in <quote>.tar.gz</quote>) from <ulink
      url="&ftpgnome;">&ftpgnome;</ulink> or its mirrors. Look in the
      /pub/GNOME/sources directory for the various packages.  The full
      list of FTP mirrors is at <ulink
      url="&wwwgnomeftp;">&wwwgnomeftp;</ulink>, in an emergency, try
      <ulink url="&ftpwgn;">&ftpwgn;</ulink>.</para>

      <para>If you want the up to the minute, bleeding edge
      development version of GNOME, CVS is the way to go.  There is no
      guarantee that the CVS version will even compile, much less
      work, but bug reports are quite appreciated.  If this sounds
      like its for you, you can find more information on getting the
      CVS version at <ulink url="&wwwgnomewicvs;">&wwwgnomewicvs;</ulink>
      and <ulink url="&wwwsorencvs;">&wwwsorencvs;</ulink>.</para>

      <para>If you don't want to deal with compiling GNOME, and you
      are on a common system, there might be precompiled binary
      packages available for you.  Currently there are packages for
      RedHat, SuSE 6.0, Debian and LinuxPPC systems.  Until recently
      there were Solaris packages as well, as soon as we have good
      ones we will offer these as well.  Find out more about the
      various distributions at <ulink
      url="&wwwgnomestart;">&wwwgnomestart;</ulink>.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1>
      <title>What do I need on my computer before I install
      GNOME?</title>

      <para>There are a few things that GNOME counts on your system
      having, if you don't have them, or have an older version,
      install or upgrade the following packages before you start the
      process of installing GNOME.</para>
      <simplelist>
	<member>libjpeg (6b or higher)</member> 
	<member>libpng (1.0.1, 1.0.3 or higher <emphasis>not
	1.0.2</emphasis></member>
	<member>libungif (3.0 or higher)</member>
	<member>libtiff (3.4 or higher)</member>
	<member>libgr (2.0 or higher)</member>
	<member>ImageMagick (4.0.5 or higher)</member>
	<member>zlib (1.1.2 or higher)</member>
	<member>guile (1.2 or higher)</member>
	<member>Berkeley DB (1.85 or higher)</member>
      </simplelist>

      <para>In addition, there are a few libraries that, while not
      technically a part of GNOME, are often distributed with it. Make
      sure you have:</para>
      <simplelist>
	<member>glib (1.2 or higher)</member>
	<member>gtk+ (1.2 or higher)</member>
	<member>ORBit (0.4.0 or higher)</member>
	<member>Imlib (1.9.3 or higher)</member>

      <para>Tarball (i.e. compressed archives of the source code using
      tar and gzip) releases of GNOME are made at <ulink
      url="&ftpgnome;">&ftpgnome;</ulink> under the <ulink
      url="&ftpgnome;/pub/GNOME">/pub/GNOME/</ulink> directory. These
      files are then copied to the GNOME FTP mirror sites, listed at

      ftp and web site are down, a relatively safe mirror is at <ulink

      <para>These tarballs are the only official releases of GNOME,
      and the only version that the developers can be guaranteed to
      have direct control over.  Currently, the most recent versions
      of each package can be found in <ulink
      url="&ftpgnome;/pub/GNOME/sources/latest">

      he keeps a few key days of each package on file, and diff files
      so that you can recreate the snapshots of any other day.  Note
      that these are not releases, they are unstable snapshots, and
      should not be used in a production system unless you know

      <title>What order do I compile the packages in?</title>

      <para>It is important that you compile and install the GNOME
      packages in the proper orders.  There are some serious
      dependencies within the GNOME tree.  Here is my suggested order,
      you should compile and install each package before you move onto
      the next.  On ld.so based systems (like Linux), you should also
      run <command>ldconfig</command> after each package.</para>

    <sect1>
      <title>How do I configure the source code for my system?
      (or... Where are the Makefiles hiding?)</title>

      <para>GNOME uses configure (generated by Autoconf) to set up the
      source code to compiler properly on your system. Configure will
      investigate how your system is set up, and define compiler
      constants to add or remove various pieces of code as
      needed.</para>

      <para>Configure accepts a variety of options, type
      <command>./configure --help</command> for the full list.  The
      most important one is <userinput>--prefix</userinput>, which
      tells the system where GNOME is to be installed.  If you omit
      the prefix, configure assumes you want
      <filename>/usr/local</filename>.  Most RPMs use a prefix of
      <filename>/usr</filename>.  Many users prefer to use a prefix of
      <userinput>/opt/gnome</userinput>, which requires a little
      advance preparation, described below.</para>

      <para>Configure also checks certain environment variables. Set
      your <envar>CFLAGS</envar> to equal whatever compiler options
      you want to make sure get passed, for example
      <userinput>-O6</userinput> will maximize optimization,
      <userinput>-g</userinput> will include debugging symbols,
      etc.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1>
      <title>Where is configure hiding?</title>

      <para>You're getting your code from CVS, aren't you?  Read the
      <link linkend="GNOMER">Becoming a GNOMEr</link> section
      below. If you got a tarball, configure should be in the top
      directory of the source.  If it's not there, that's a bug.  See
      the <link linkend="BUGREPORT">How do I report a bug?</link>
      question.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1>
      <title>OK, I've got a Makefile now. How do I get GNOME on my
      system?</title>

      <para>From here, it's pretty straightforward.  You type
      <command>make</command>, followed by <command>make
      install</command>.  On most systems (including Linux), this
      should be followed by <command>ldconfig</command>.  If you're in
      a rush, you can sometimes skip <command>make</command>, since
      <command>make install</command> will usually make everything
      that hasn't been made yet.  If you want to start the whole
      process and forget about it, and are running the Bourne shell or
      its derivatives (eg. ksh or bash), put all four commands on one
      line, separated by <userinput>&&</userinput>.  For
      example:</para><screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>./configure --prefix=/opt/gnome && make && make install && ldconfig</userinput></screen>
	
      <para>The <userinput>&&</userinput> makes sure that the first
      command succeeded before going onto the next one.</para>

      <para>Once you've done <command>make install</command> (and
      <command>ldconfig</command> if needed), you can continue on to
      the next package.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1>
      <title>How do I put GNOME someplace special, like
      <filename>/opt/gnome</filename>?</title>

      <para>Many people like to put GNOME off by itself, in its own
      directory.  Doing this makes it easier to uninstall in an
      emergency, easier to control who has access to GNOME, it lets
      you export the gnome directory to other systems, and so on. To
      do this requires a little bit of preparation.  I'll walk through
      the steps on a system that uses ld.so, where all users are to
      have access to GNOME.  I'll be putting GNOME in the
      <filename>/opt/gnome</filename> directory. Just replace
      <filename>/opt/gnome</filename> with whatever other directory
      you want.</para>

      <para>The biggest issue are making sure the system can find the
      GNOME binaries in <filename>/opt/gnome/bin</filename>, the
      libraries in <filename>/opt/gnome/lib</filename>, and the man
      files in <filename>/opt/gnome/man</filename>. First, create
      those directories.  Then, add a line to
      <filename>/etc/ld.so.conf</filename> saying
      <userinput>/opt/gnome/lib</userinput>, and then run
      <command>ldconfig</command>.  Next, insert a line into
      <filename>/etc/profile</filename>, saying <userinput>export
      PATH="$PATH:/opt/gnome/bin"</userinput>.  Lastly, insert a line
      into <filename>/etc/man.config</filename>, saying
      <userinput>MANPATH /opt/gnome/man</userinput>.</para>

      <para>The other issue is there are a couple of directories which
      GNOME will put things in, which would be better put elsewhere.
      The easiest way of doing this is with symbolic links.  Type the
      following:</para><screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>mkdir /opt/gnome/share</userinput>
<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>cd /opt/gnome/share</userinput>
<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>ln -s /usr/share/locale locale</userinput>
<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>ln -s /usr/share/aclocal aclocal</userinput></screen>

      <para>Now you're all set to use <filename>/opt/gnome</filename>
      as a prefix when compiling.  To do this, just give the
      <command>./configure</command> command the option
      <option>--prefix=/opt/gnome</option>.  Of course, if you want
      someplace special other than <filename>/opt/gnome</filename>,
      just replace it with the directory you do want in all the
      instances above.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1>
      <title>I'm done with this module, how do I get rid of all the
      object files and other cruft from the source tree?</title>

      <para>You have three options, <command>make clean</command>,
      <command>make distclean</command> or removing the
      directory. Using <command>make clean</command> will remove all
      the object files, built executables, and miscellaneous cruft,
      it's nice and safe.  The next option, <command>make
      distclean</command> should remove everything that wasn't in the
      original tarball. If you do this, you will not be able to <link
      linkend="UNINSTALL">uninstall the module</link>.  The same goes
      for removing the source directory.  Basically, <command>make
      clean</command> is good for general use, the others should be

	processor type: Sparc, MIPS, i386 (this includes Pentiums,
	AMD, Cyrix, etc), PPC, Alpha, ARM, 680x0, et al; we need
	operating system: Linux, FreeBSD, HURD, OpenBSD, Solaris,
	IRIX, CrayOS, OS/400, whatever.  Also include the version of
	the operating system. For example, the machine I'm on right
	now is a RedHat Linux/i386 Rawhide machine, a friend of mine
	uses a Solaris Sparc 2.6 machine.</para>

	<para>Next, we need some relevant vital statistics of what is
	on your system.  On a Linux system, the kernel and libc
	version numbers are almost always relevant.  On almost all
	GNOME problems we need your glib, gtk+, Imlib, ORBit and
	gnome-libs versions.  If you aren't sure if you need any of
	the above, include them anyway.  Other things that are
	sometimes relevant are versions of Perl, X11, Python, Guile
	and libpng, unless you see an error message that mentions one
	of them, you can leave them out.  Also important is how you
	installed GNOME.  Did you use binaries, if so which ones?  Did
	you use tarballs?  Did you use CVS, if so which dates and/or
	tags?  If you used a mixture of the above, tell us.</para>

	<para>Lastly, we need the problem itself.  We need to know
	exactly what you did to get the problem.  We need to know if
	the problem is consistent or intermittent.  We need to know if
	the program output anything prior to the problem.  We need to
	know exactly what happens when you run into the problem.  If
	you want to get ambitious, try some of the diagnostic tools I
	discuss below, such as a backtrace, and include the
	information in the mail.</para>

	<para>Now before you are ready to post, you need to come up
	with a good subject line.  Gnome-list can have a lot of
	messages on it, you want yours to stand out to the people you
	need help from, and be safely passed over by people who can't
	help.  A subject of "GNOME is broken" is likely to get passed
	over; one of "GSM sucks" will get people in an angry mood, not
	a helpful one; something like "Most panel icons on HP-UX are
	just black squares" is likely to get the right sort of
	attention.</para>

	<para>Put this all together into one long email and post it
	onto the list.  If you followed my advice, you are more likely
	to get a quick, thoughtful response. If for some reason you
	don't get a quick response, don't take it personally, the mail
	probably just got lost in the volume.  Wait a couple of days,
	see if there is any detail you can add, or perhaps a more
	descriptive header, and post it again.</para>

      <sect2 id="BugReport">
	<title>How do I report a bug?</title>

	<para>If you find a bug, we want to know about it, we want to
	track it, and we want to fix it.  To make this process as
	efficient as possible, we borrowed Debian's excellent bug
	tracking system.  Full instructions on how to use it can be
	found at <ulink url="&wwwgnomebugr;">
	&wwwgnomebugr;</ulink>.</para>

	<para>There are a few things to keep in mind in sending bugs
	to the system.  First make sure to check the web front end at
	<ulink url="&wwwgnomebug;">&wwwgnomebug;</ulink> to make sure
	that your bug isn't yet known to the system.  If it is a new
	bug, send it to <ulink url="&mailbug;">&mailbug;</ulink>.
	Make sure you include the Package and Version headings as
	described in the instructions, this will make sure it gets
	routed quickly and automatically to the right people.  Make
	sure you include full details.  See the previous question for
	some suggestions on what is useful to include.  If a backtrace
	or strace is appropriate, by all means include it.
	Instructions on how to do this is given below.</para>

	<para>After you submit the bug to the system.  You will get
	feedback on the bug via email.  You also can track the status
	of the bug through the bug tracking system's web front
	end.</para>

	<title>What is a prefix (or a $prefix, ${PREFIX}, or
	&lt;prefix&gt;)?</title>

	<para>When GNOME is compiled, you need to specify where it is
	located in the filesystem.  The option used to specify this is
	called <option>--prefix</option>, so we call it the GNOME
	Prefix, or prefix for short.  GNOME's file locations should be
	the same from system to system, except for the prefix, so a
	file in <filename>/usr/share/gnome/pixmaps</filename> on one
	system may be in
	<filename>/opt/gnome/share/gnome/pixmaps</filename> on
	another, and we would refer to the location as
	<filename>$prefix/share/gnome/pixmaps</filename>.</para>

	<para>If you installed from tarballs (or CVS), but never gave
	<command>configure</command> (or
	<command>autogen.sh</command>) a prefix, the default is
	<filename>/usr/local</filename>.  If you installed the RedHat
	RPMS, they use a prefix of <filename>/usr</filename>.  If you
	still aren't sure, type <command>which panel</command>, and
	remove the <computeroutput>/bin/panel</computeroutput> from
	the end.  What's left is your prefix. </para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
	<title>What does <computeroutput>Segmentation
	Fault</computeroutput> mean?</title>

	<para>Most Unix and Unix like systems have a feature called
	memory protection.  What this means is the program is allowed
	to access some parts of memory (often called segments), but
	not others.  If the program tries to access memory outside of
	the segments it is permitted to access, the system detects the
	problem and signals an error.  This error is called a
	Segmentation Fault (abbreviated <quote>segv</quote> on some
	systems), and generally, the program will end suddenly, often
	leaving behind a core dump (see below).</para>

	<para>What it all boils down to is there is a bug in whatever
	program you were running.  The bug might be in the GNOME
	source code, it might be in the shared libraries your program
	uses, or it might be in the way the program was compiled.  If
	you are unsure whether it is a bug in GNOME or somewhere else,
	ask about it on the list.  If you are sure the bug lies within
	GNOME, please make sure it's on the bug tracking
	system.</para>

      <sect2 id="Core">
	<title>What is a core dump?  What is this file named core that
	I keep running into?</title>

	<para>In the early days of electronic computers, computer
	memory was a bunch of magnetic rings called cores, mounted on
	wires.  This type of memory was called core memory.  When a
	programmer wanted to see what was going on in their program,
	they would output a copy of what was in their core memory so
	they could analyze it.  This output was called a core dump,
	and the term has remained long after core memory became
	obsolete.</para>

	<para>In many Unix and Unix-like systems, the system will
	automatically produce a core dump when a program fails
	catastrophically, for example when it has a Segmentation Fault
	(see above).  It generally puts the core dump into a file
	named <filename>core</filename> in the directory you were in
	when you ran the program.  This file is very useful for
	debugging why the program failed, and can be used to produce a
	backtrace (see below).  On the other hand, this file can be
	quite large, particularly if you aren't using it for
	debugging.  If you can't afford to have core dumps, consult
	your system documentation to find out how to disable this
	feature.</para>

	<para>In general, it means that it is having trouble finding

	sure it is installed.  If it isn't, then find it and install
	it.  It should be included in all major Unixes and Unix-like
	systems.</para>

	<para>If it is installed properly, and you still get the
	error, than check to see if there are any other copies of libz
	floating around.  One place where it often is hiding when
	people have problems is in
	<filename>/usr/X11R6/lib</filename>, since XFree86 puts a copy
	there.  It is probably safe to just delete it, but if you
	aren't sure, rename it to something like
	<filename>libz.so.renamed</filename>, that way it won't be
	found by the linker, and if you run into problems elsewhere
	because of the renaming, you can just rename it back.</para>

	<title>What is CORBA?</title>

	<para><ulink
	url="http://www.omg.org/news/begin.htm">CORBA</ulink> is the
	Common Object Request Broker Architecture.  From the Open
	Management Group (OMG, the standards body which controls
	CORBA) document <ulink
	url="http://www.omg.org/about/wicorba.htm">What is
	CORBA?</ulink> comes the following description:</para>

        <blockquote>
	  <para>The Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA),
	  is the Object Management Group's answer to the need for
	  inter-operability among the rapidly proliferating number of
	  hardware and software products available today. Simply
	  stated, CORBA allows applications to communicate with one
	  another no matter where they are located or who has designed
	  them(...)</para>

	  <para>The (ORB) is the middleware that establishes the
	  client-server relationships between objects. Using an ORB, a
	  client can transparently invoke a method on a server object,
	  which can be on the same machine or across a network. The
	  ORB intercepts the call and is responsible for finding an
	  object that can implement the request, pass it the
	  parameters, invoke its method, and return the results. The
	  client does not have to be aware of where the object is
	  located, its programming language, its operating system, or
	  any other system aspects that are not part of an object's
	  interface. In so doing, the ORB provides inter-operability
	  between applications on different machines in heterogeneous
	  distributed environments and seamlessly interconnects
	  multiple object systems.</para>

	  <para>In fielding typical client/server applications,
	  developers use their own design or a recognized standard to
	  define the protocol to be used between the devices. Protocol
	  definition depends on the implementation language, network
	  transport and a dozen other factors. ORBs simplify this
	  process. With an ORB, the protocol is defined through the
	  application interfaces via a single implementation
	  language-independent specification, the IDL (Ed. Interface
	  Description Language).  And ORBs provide flexibility. They
	  let programmers choose the most appropriate operating
	  system, execution environment and even programming language
	  to use for each component of a system under
	  construction. More importantly, they allow the integration
	  of existing components. In an ORB-based solution, developers
	  simply model the legacy component using the same IDL they
	  use for creating new objects, then write "wrapper" code that
	  translates between the standardized bus and the legacy
	  interfaces.</para>
	</blockquote>

	<para>OK, enough of that stuff. Here's Todd's
	explanation:</para>

	<blockquote>
	  <para>Do you remember RPC? You know, Remote Procedure Calls?
	  Sun used them as the basis for NFS and NIS. Microsoft used
	  the Distributed Computing Environment's RPC standard as the
	  basis for DCOM.</para>

	  <para>Well, a remote procedure call is really pretty
	  simple. First, you define the procedure in some standard
	  format. What is there to a procedure definition?  Well,
	  you've got the name of the procedure, the arguments which go
	  into it, and the results which come out of it. Then you
	  produce the client side, which tells clients how to feed in
	  arguments and get back results, and then you build the
	  server side, which takes in arguments and gives back
	  results.</para>

	  <para>You can use this model to build pretty powerful
	  systems. Just take the standard Unix file system interface,
	  convert it to RPC, and bammo, you've got NFS. Note that as
	  long as the inputs and outputs are thrown around in a
	  standard way, the clients calling the procedure and the
	  server servicing the procedure don't have to be written in
	  the same language, running on the same machine, or even
	  running on the same operating system or hardware. This is,
	  truth be told, the killer feature of RPC.</para>

	  <para>However, as procedural programming (C, Perl) has been
	  superseded by object-oriented programming (Objective C,
	  Java, C++), you really need something more the procedures in
	  RPC. You need something which supports objects: creating
	  objects, accessing object data, accessing object methods,
	  destroying objects. This is where CORBA comes in: think of
	  CORBA as next-generation RPC, just extended to support
	  object-oriented programming. Instead of having under RPC the
	  following:</para>

	  <programlisting>void foo(int bar); void baz(){return(-1);}</programlisting>

	  <para>you instead have under CORBA the following:</para>

	  <programlisting>interface bubba{ void foo(in int bar); void baz() raises (InValidContext); } </programlisting>

	  <para>The lesson of all of this? CORBA lets one program
	  language-independent, location-transparent object-oriented
	  interfaces between software components. It' s cool.</para>

	</blockquote>

      <sect2>
	<title>What are some CORBA components?</title>

	<para>I would like to include here definitions of some of the
	more strange CORBA terminology, so that people can easily get
	into the groove of what CORBA is and have a good
	"beck-of-the-envelope" understanding of the components
	involved.  Whenever I refer to a non-obvious CORBA term, I
	intend to define it here.</para>
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para><firstterm>Object Request Broker</firstterm> - (or
	    ORB) an ORB is a piece of "middleware", as it's called,
	    which sits between clients and servers and makes easy
	    communication between them possible. The ORB is a
	    conceptual entity, which sometimes takes the form of a
	    shared library and sometimes takes the form of an external
	    program.  the ORB is responsible for establishing and
	    destroying sessions between clients and servers and
	    marshaling, unmarshaling, and transporting messages
	    between them during a session.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para><firstterm>Object Adaptor</firstterm> - (or OA) an
	    Object Adaptor provides the channel through which an
	    object server (like the gnome panel) communicates with the
	    Object Request Broker (ORBit).</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para><firstterm>GIOP/IIOP</firstterm> - CORBA takes all
	    of these object-oriented language-isms and handles
	    carrying them between object-oriented software components
	    (marshaling, transporting, and demarshaling). If the two
	    pieces of software are in different locations, then it
	    will use the GIOP protocol to move information between
	    them. IIOP is a specification of GIOP for the Internet
	    protocol suite; theoretically you could run GIOP over
	    something other than IP, in which case it would be called
	    something else. I for one can't figure out why you would
	    want to. 8^) If any version of GIOP other than IIOP ever
	    became important, then I'm sure that ORBit would support
	    it, too. (Think of IIOP as HTML to GIOP's SGML.)</para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
	<title>What are CORBA Services?</title>

	<para>Additionally, there are really two parts to CORBA. There
	is the part which I've already described, which tells you how
	to do objectified RPC, how to marshal arguments, how to write
	IDL files, how GIOP works, etc. and then there are the "CORBA
	Services". These are services built on top of the basic CORBA
	infrastructure which make distributed object programming
	easier.</para>

	<para>Perhaps the most important of these is the naming
	service. E.g., say that you were a program which for some
	reason needed spell-checking services. One really neat thing
	that you can do (if your CORBA implementation is nifty enough)
	is to call up your ORB and say "Hey! I need spell-check
	service. Go find it for me." The ORB then uses the naming
	service to see what objects are registered which provide
	spell-check service. It can then wake up the calling program
	and say "You can find the spell- check service at
	&num;867-5309." You then call up 867-5309 and, lo and behold,
	there's a spell check service there. Now, that might be a
	shared library which got mapped into your address space and
	you are now doing straight function calls into it, or it might
	be a community spell-check service in Myanmar offered as a
	public service by the Myanmar FreeBSD users' group over the
	internet via IIOP. You don't know and, except for maybe a
	little lag induced by the round-trip to Myanmar, you really
	don't care. Cool, non?</para>

	<para>The naming service, then, allows objects to register
	themselves for future use. There are other CORBA services,
	including a transaction service, a security service, a time
	service, a "relationship service", which might or might not be
	what you think it is, and more. My copy of the CORBAservices
	document from March 1997 lists 14 of them.</para>

	<para>You can find a copy of the CORBAservices specification
	at the OMG web page at <ulink
	url="http://www.omg.org/corba/csindx.htm">http://www.omg.org/corba/csindx.htm</ulink>.
	If you are interested in implementing any of them, then I'm
	sure that the ORBit developers would love to talk to you.

	<title>What role does CORBA play in GNOME?</title>

	<para>CORBA enables the component architecture of GNOME. It

      </sect2>

      <sect2>
	<title>What CORBA implementation is GNOME using?</title>

	<para>In the beginning, the plan was to use <ulink
	url="ftp://parcftp.parc.xerox.com/pub/ilu/ilu.html">
	ILU</ulink>.  ILU had a number of benefits, foremost among
	them that it supports several languages.  While ILU was (and
	is) awfully neat, Xerox's attitude towards it was unclear, and
	the licensing terms proved to be fatal: ILU is not open
	source, and the GNOME team proved unable to get Xerox to
	modify the license. The GNOME project won't adopt technology
	which is not open source, and that was the end of that.</para>

	<para>The project then settled upon <ulink
	url="http://diamant-atm.vsb.cs.uni-frankfurt.de/~mico/">
	MICO</ulink>.  The main attractions of MICO are that it has an
	Object Adaptor, it is IIOP-compliant, and it is licensed under
	the terms of the GPL. However, it does not presently support
	languages other than C++, and it used just an unbelievably
	amount of memory.</para>

	<para>Still dissatisfied, the GNOMErs began work on our own
	ORB, called ORBit.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2 id="ORBit">
	<title>What is ORBit?</title>

	<para>ORBit is intended to be multilingual; ILU proves that
	this is possible.  Right now it only supports C, but in the
	future it will support other languages.  (Really, we mean it!
	It is a very, very new project right now, which is the only
	reason it is C only.) It also supports GIOP/IIOP, the OMG's
	CORBA protocol which allows different ORBs to be able to talk
	to each other.</para>

	<para>Finally, ORBit is intended to be high performance. That
	means low-memory and high-speed. Here, ORBit is taking a lot
	of cues from <ulink
	url="http://www.cs.utah.edu/projects/flux/flick/">
	Flick</ulink>.  Elliot Lee, the instigator of the ORBit
	project, thinks that he can, without violating the CORBA spec,
	get the cost of a CORBA call darn close to that of a standard
	library call, where a local implementation of the requested
	service is available. We'll see.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
	<title>Why has GNOME not made more use of CORBA?</title>

	<para>The big reason is that MICO was just unworkable. it took
	too much memory, it was C++ only, etc. ad naus. With the
	recent release of the GNOME ORBit, we can start deploying
	CORBA in the GNOME.</para>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>GNOME Applications as service providers: GNOME
	    applications will export their inner workings through

	    GNOME server (for example, a script in Perl can control
	    remotely invoke a spreadsheet to make a graph or to make a

	<title>What role does GTK+ play in GNOME?</title>

	<para>GTK+ is the interface which GNOME applications use to
	interact with the user. It is similar to the role of Motif in
	CDE, Qt in KDE or the-widget-set-which-has-no-name in
	Win32.</para>

      <sect2>
	<title>What languages does GTK+ support?</title>

	<para>You can write GTK+ programs in tons of languages! Your
	humble FAQ author knows of the following bindings:</para>
	<simplelist>
	  <member>C (original)</member>
	  <member>C++</member>
	  <member>Objective C</member>
	  <member>Python</member>
	  <member>Perl 5</member>
	  <member>Scheme (Guile)</member>
	  <member>TOM</member>
	  <member>Gwydion Dylan</member>
	</simplelist>

	<para>If there are others, then please let us know about
	them. (See Section <link linkend="ContactFAQ">Contact the FAQ
	Maintainer</link>)</para>

	<para>You are encouraged to add bindings to other languages
	should the fancy strike you. N.b., that the Scheme bindings
	already have a formalized representation of the API, so if you
	want to start working on new bindings, then you might want to
	start from here.</para>

	<para>Having written that, I have to wonder if we can't
	somehow use CORBA to cut this Gordian knot. If the ORBit
	developers can get the cost of a local CORBA call down to that
	of a normal shared-library call, then why not CORBify GTK and
	work on adding bindings for new languages to ORBit? I know,
	the conventional wisdom is that CORBA is too heavyweight for
	high-volume stuff like X calls.  Hey, don't blame me for
	throwing out crazy ideas: the reason I maintain the FAQ is
	that I can't program!</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2 id="Imlib">
	<title>What is imlib?</title>

	<para>Along with GTK, GNOME uses imlib, an image library for X
	which supports multiple image formats transparently to the
	programmer. Imlib can even use external converter programs
	like ImageMagick or pmbplus to convert unknown image formats
	to known formats, so if a converter exists for an image type,
	you can almost certainly use that image type in your
	application! Imlib also supports multiple bit-depths, from
	24-bit down to 1-bit monochrome, again transparently to the
	programmer, and does intelligent color map allocation and
	automatic dithering to get the best possible performance out
	of your display. Anyone who has ever tried to do this in their
	X apps, or who has had to endure their screen flashing when
	apps have to allocate a private color map, you will especially
	like this feature.</para>

      <sect2 id="Themes">
	<title>What's the deal with themes?</title>

	<para>Themes let you change the look and feel of GTK+
	applications without recompiling them. Eventually, you should
	be able to change the theme of all GTK+ apps on a given display
	at the same time. For now, though, you can hard-code the theme
	at startup.</para>

	<para>To see some examples of what themed GTK+ apps look like,
	take a look at: <ulink url="http://gtk.themes.org">
	http://gtk.themes.org</ulink>.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
	<title>How do I get themes working?</title>

	<para>OK, I have gotten themes working on my machine; this is
	roughly how I did it.  First, you have to reinstall GTK. Do a
	"make uninstall" on your present install, and then do the
	following:</para>

<screen>
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>cvs get -r themes-2 -d themes-gtk+ gtk+</userinput>
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>cd themes-gtk+</userinput>
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>./autogen.sh --prefix=/opt/gnome &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</userinput>
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>cd themes</userinput>
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>./autogen.sh --prefix=/opt/gnome &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</userinput></screen>

	<para>You need the new imlib installed to do this; if you get
	an error because of an undefined AM_PATH_GDK_IMLIB, it's
	because imlib.m4 is not found, either because you don't have a
	new imlib, or because of normal Autoconf m4 file issues.  (See
	<link linkend="Autoconf">Autoconf</link>)</para>

	<para>This should give you a working, themefied version of
	GTK+. Now, you need to do the following. Remember, in these
	examples, you should replace "/opt/gnome" with wherever you
	have gnome installed, which might be some place
	different.</para>

<screen>
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>cd /opt/gnome/share</userinput>
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>mv gtkrc gtkrc.orig</userinput>
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>ln -s gtk/themes/$(theme)/gtkrc gtkrc</userinput></screen>

	<para>Where $(theme) is one of the subdirectories of
	gtk/themes; at present there are the following:</para>
	<simplelist>
	  <member>Pixmap</member>
	  <member>Redmond95 (a Win95-like theme)</member>
	  <member>Notif (a Motif-like theme)</member>
	  <member>Metal</member>
	</simplelist>

	<para>That's it! After you make this symbolic link, all new GTK apps
	will be started with that the theme. You can even have
	multiple apps with multiple themes running at the same time. A
	theme lasts for the duration of that application.</para>

	<para>I was changing themes so often that I came up with a
	silly shell script to do it for me. Here it is:</para>

	<programlisting>
#!/bin/sh

ls -l /opt/gnome/share/gtkrc

cd /opt/gnome/share/
test -f gtkrc &amp;&amp; mv gtkrc gtkrc.orig

echo "select from the following theme choices:"
cd /opt/gnome/share/gtk/themes/
find -name gtkrc | sed 'sH^\.\/HHg;sH\/gtkrc&dollar;HHg'

cd /opt/gnome/share/
theme=
while ! test -f gtk/themes/&dollar;theme/gtkrc
do
   echo -n "Choose a theme: "
   read theme
done

rm -f gtkrc
ln -s gtk/themes/&dollar;theme/gtkrc gtkrc

	<title>What are Internationalization(I18N) and
	Localization(L10N)?</title>

	<para>From the GNU gettext info page:</para>

	<para>By <firstterm>internationalization</firstterm>, one
	refers to the operation by which a program, or a set of
	programs turned into a package, is made aware and able to
	support multiple languages. This is a generalization process,
	by which the programs are untied from using only English
	strings or other English specific habits, and connected to
	generic ways of doing the same, instead. Program developers
	may use various techniques to internationalize their programs,
	some of them have been standardized. GNU gettext offers one of
	these standards.</para>

	<para>By <firstterm>localization</firstterm>, one means the
	operation by which, in a set of programs already
	internationalized, one gives the program all needed
	information so that it can bend itself to handle its input and
	output in a fashion which is correct for some native language
	and cultural habits. This is a particularisation process, by
	which generic methods already implemented in an
	internationalized program are used in specific ways. The
	programming environment puts several functions to the
	programmers disposal which allow this runtime
	configuration. The formal description of specific set of
	cultural habits for some country, together with all associated
	translations targeted to the same native language, is called
	the locale for this language or country. Users achieve
	localization of programs by setting proper values to special
	environment variables, prior to executing those programs,
	identifying which locale should be used.</para>

    <sect1 id="Autoconf">
      <title>What is Autoconf? What does it have to do with
      GNOME?</title>

      <para>Autoconf is a tool for producing shell scripts that
      automatically configure source code to adapt to the system you
      are using.  Autoconf is invaluable, since it makes the
      development of such configure scripts drastically easier. GNOME
      uses it alongside the related tool, Automake, which allows
      Autoconf to produce custom Makefiles for your system.  Autoconf
      uses m4 to operate.  M4 is a powerful (but arcane) macro
      language used by many GNU utilities.  Most of the macros used to
      generate these files are found in either
      <filename>/usr/share/aclocal</filename> or the
      <filename>macros</filename> subdirectory of the source tree.</para>

      <para>If you are using the tarballs, Autoconf and Automake have
      already been run for you, so you don't need them on your system.
      If you use CVS, you won't get very far without having recent
      versions of these tools.  You can find more information about
      Autoconf at <ulink url="&wwwgnuaconf;"> &wwwgnuaconf;</ulink>,
      and Automake at <ulink url="&wwwgnuamake;">
      &wwwgnuamake;</ulink>.</para>

      <para>Keep in mind, that <filename>configure</filename>,
      <filename>config.h</filename>, <filename>Makefile</filename>,
      and even <filename>Makefile.in</filename> are all constructed
      files.  If you need to change them, you shouldn't patch them
      directly, but rather modify the files used to create them:
      <filename>configure.in</filename>,
      <filename>config.h.in</filename>, and
      <filename>Makefile.am</filename>.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="Libtool">
      <title>What is Libtool?  What does it have to do with
      GNOME?</title>

      <para>Libtool is an important portability utility.  It gives a
      common interface to the mechanics of building, debugging and
      maintaining static and dynamic libraries on most computer
      systems in use.  It works in three phases, the
      <command>libtoolize</command> command adds libtool support to a source
      tree by adding the <command>ltconfig</command> script.  This
      script, in turn, generates a system-specific script called
      <command>libtool</command> in the source tree.  The
      <command>libtool</command> script is the part that actually gets
      all the work done.</para>

      <para>Like Autoconf and Automake, if you are using CVS, you need
      Libtool installed on your system.  If you use the tarballs,
      <command>libtoolize</command> as already been run, and
      <command>ltconfig</command> is self-contained, so you do not
      need Libtool to be installed.  More information about libtool

      <para>If you want to get seriously involved with GNOME, you
      really have to join the gnome-list mailing list (See <link
      linkend="MailingList">Mailing Lists</link>, above).  Check the
      list of mailing lists to see what other lists interest you.
      Also, make sure you read the GNOME Manifesto at <ulink
      url="&wwwgnomemanif;">&wwwgnomemanif;</ulink> and the articles
      on the GNU Project Philosophy at <ulink
      url="&wwwgnuphil;">&wwwgnuphil;</ulink> to make sure you know
      what kind of project you're getting involved in.  You don't have
      to agree with all of the philosophy in order to contribute to
      GNOME, but at least respect that some of us are committed to the
      ideas given in these documents.</para>

      <para>Since GNOME is a software project, we obviously can always
      use more programmers, but you don't have to be a programmer to
      help out with GNOME.  We also can always use more people sending
      in clear bug reports.  There is always more documentation to be
      written.  If you speak more than one language, we can always use
      translators, both of the documentation and of the labels,
      buttons and menu entries within the applications.  People
      willing to make binary packages for their system are quite
      welcome, particularly if nobody else is making binaries yet for
      that system.  People willing and able to mirror our WWW, FTP
      and/or CVS servers are enthusiastically encouraged to do
      so.</para>

      <title>How do I get the bleeding edge, CVS versions of
      GNOME?</title>

      <para>If you are developing for GNOME, or if you just want to
      keep more up-to-date than the latest release, you should
      consider using our CVS system.  There is the main CVS server,
      which you need an account for, and a network of mirrors of the
      server, which anyone can read from.  This network of mirrors is
      collectively called Anonymous CVS, and they all can be accessed
      at anoncvs.gnome.org (they are set up with round-robin DNS to
      balance out the load).  If you are looking to contribute source
      code to the GNOME project, you will eventually want an account
      on the main CVS server, but get used to the Anonymous CVS system
      first, so you are familiar with how GNOME makes use of
      CVS.</para>

      <para>Directions on how to access the Anonymous CVS system are at
      <ulink url="&wwwgnomewicvs;">&wwwgnomewicvs;</ulink>.  There is also
      a very useful guide at <ulink
      url="&wwwsorencvs;">&wwwsorencvs;</ulink>.  The anonymous CVS
      servers should be updating themselves </para>

      <para>In order to use the CVS version, you need to have GNU
      tools installed on your system.  You need at least GNU Autoconf,
      Automake, Libtool and m4.  If your system doesn't include these,
      you can get them from the GNU website at <ulink
      url="&wwwgnu;">&wwwgnu;</ulink>.</para>

    <sect1>
      <title>I want bleeding edge GNOME, but I can't use CVS.  How do
      I get it?</title>

      <para>There are some occasions where CVS just isn't feasible.
      Perhaps you want to make sure GNOME works using just the native
      tools for your system instead of the GNU tools.  Perhaps you are
      sitting on the other side of a firewall that blocks the CVS
      port.  Whatever your reason, Jim Pick Software offers daily
      snapshots of the CVS version, in tarball form, available via FTP
      at <ulink url="&ftpsnap;">&ftpsnap;</ulink>.  The conversion to
      tarball form bypasses the need for GNU tools as well.</para>

      <title>How do I get an account to let me contribute to the CVS
      version of GNOME?</title>

      <para>If you plan on contributing code to the project, then you

      url="mailto:miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx">
      miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx</ulink>) determines who gets accounts on
      the CVS server; if you would like one, then send him a message
      detailing what code you plan on writing, along with with a
      crypted password. You can get that by doing the
      following:</para>

      <para><userinput>perl -e 'print crypt ("YourPassword",
      "salt");'</userinput></para>

      <title>Why are directories sometimes missing when I update a
      module from CVS?</title>

      <para>CVS has an excellent feature with an annoying quirk about
      it.  CVS allows a module to include other modules, a feature
      which GNOME uses to better organize things and to reduce
      duplication of code.  Unfortunately, the <command>cvs
      update</command> command doesn't bother to check to see if any
      new modules are included off of the main module.  If you think
      there is a missing piece, use <command>cvs get</command>
      instead, it will check for new included modules.  Don't worry,
      as long as the source tree is there, it won't try to do a brand
      new checkout, it will act the same as <command>cvs
      update</command> as far as only downloading what is new or
      updated.</para>
