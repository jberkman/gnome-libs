        * users-faq-1.2/whatisgnome.sgml: tidy up.
	* users-faq-1.2/platforms.sgml: id="runson": added OS/2 link.
	* users-faq-1.2/x11.sgml: 
		id="x11-intro": John Kodis explains this much better than me.
		id="x11-net": X-server!=X-client. X-server!=X-client. Ahem. 
                From numerous people. Ouch.                 
		id="windowmanagers"": latest fvwm is compliant. (Adam Sampson)
        * users-faq-1.2/installing.sgml: 
		id="getting-helix": "Rumoured to run on potato"->"Runs on"
		id="get-not-helix": BSD ports. Solaris resources.
	* users-faq-1.2/compiling.sgml:
		id="double-gnome": Added Eric Baudais's method of compiling
		GNOME into home directory without nuking a currently-working
		setup. Was too scared to try doing it myself.
		id="gnome-stylesheets": debs available too now.
		id="uninstalling": unmuddled apt-get/dpkg and --purge
	* users-faq-1.2/starting.sgml:
		id="start-from-x": method for at least some Linux systems.
		I'm sure SuSE is different :)
	* users-faq-1.2/using.sgml:
		id="middle-clicking": Added how to do this in Exceed. For
		the benefit of people using it, even if it's not free. If
		this FAQ ends up on the GNOME site, I suspect this will have
		to go. 
		id="running-root-progs": Made "don't need to be root for
		helix-update" clearer.
	* users-faq-1.2/problems.sgml:
		id="x-resolution": Why not to experiment too much with 
		XF86Config

		id="shmget-error": from Dan Mueth.
	* users-faq-1.2/extras.sgml:
		id="package-jobs": grammar fixes.
	* users-faq-1.2/resources.sgml:
		id="info-net": added three searchable archives of gnome-list
                (somelist from Fabien Penso), the correct list for BSD
                (Andrew Mobbs), the xfree86 newbie list, and every GNOME-
                related bug-tracker I could think of. Just because.
                Also removed a massive <itemizedlist> because it was silly.
	* users-faq-1.2/joining.sgml:
		id="joining-non-hacking": updated GTP and GDP locations,
		added gnome-icons project.
	* users-faq-1.2/meta.sgml:
		Added lots more contributors.

	* users-faq-1.2/whatisgnome.sgml: trivia: gnome 0.30 was a bouncing
	bonobo, not a baboon. Easy mistake to make.

	* TODO: updated.

2000-07-30 Telsa Gwynne <hobbit@aloss.ukuu.org.uk>

	the GNOME docs stuff installed or work-arounds to avoid having to.
        (Defeats the point, but still).

	Nautilus is a shell which will contain a file manager component.
	Repeat ten times after me.
	* users-faq-1.2/resources.sgml: Added Slackware resources and
	Red Hat's well-hidden mailing list.

2000-05-26 Telsa Gwynne <hobbit@aloss.ukuu.org.uk>

	* Completely rewrote the users-faq.sgml to be vaguely up-to-
	date. Put it in users-faq-1.2/ directory to avoid confusion.
        Primary doc is users-faq: the others are entities included into
        it. Added content to README. Added a TODO list. Feel free to do 
        the todos.
