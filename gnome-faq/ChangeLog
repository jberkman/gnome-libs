		id="x11-intro": John Kodis explains this much better than me.
		id="x11-net": X-server!=X-client. X-server!=X-client. Ahem. 
                From numerous people. Ouch.

                related bug-tracker I could think of. Just because.

	Red Hat's well-hidden mailing list.

	date. Put it in users-faq-1.2/ directory to avoid confusion.
        Primary doc is users-faq: the others are entities included into
        it. Added content to README. Added a TODO list. Feel free to do 
        the todos.
