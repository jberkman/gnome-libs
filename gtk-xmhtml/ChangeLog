	* XmHTML-motif.c, XmHTML.c, XmHTMLP.h, callbacks.c, forms.c,
	frames.c, gtk-xmhtml.c gtk-xmhtml.h images.c, map.c, test.c,
	toolkit.c: More code sharing between the Motif frontend an the Gtk
	frontned;   More portability macros;  

	* The widget now emits signals for all of the events that are
	interesting (same as the Motif ones, but signalified). 

	* Lots of events are now handled, only missing are the keybaord
	events.
