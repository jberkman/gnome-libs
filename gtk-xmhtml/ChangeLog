	* Lots of changes all over the place to fix colors.  Things are
	*almost* working right now.  I think I'm only missing setting the
	window backgrounds appropriately.  Several things were done:

		- Motif's color and gc fields from Core and XmManager were
		  replicated inside the GtkXmHTML widget structure.

		- Macros were created in toolkit.h to use these fields.

		- Instead of the old kludgy set_{fore,back}ground_internal
		  functions, we now set the window background directly.
		  This does not work perfectly; I'll look into it.

		- I created a shade_color() function in colors.c (ok, ok,
		  I stole it from gtkstyle.c) which mimics XmGetColors()
		  -- it calculates shaded colors for the 3D look.

	I hope to fix the remaining problems with window backgrounds real
	soon now.

	* images.c (_XmHTMLFillXImage): Created a my_gtk_image_new()
	function that is just like the GDK_IMAGE_NORMAL part of the real
	gdk_image_new(), but it also supports specification of the padding
	and bytes_per_line parameters.  This fixes the non-working images
	on 16bpp.  Let's see later about images with less than 8bpp...

	* XmHTML-motif.c, XmHTML.c, XmHTMLP.h, callbacks.c, forms.c,
	frames.c, gtk-xmhtml.c gtk-xmhtml.h images.c, map.c, test.c,
	toolkit.c: More code sharing between the Motif frontend an the Gtk
	frontned;   More portability macros;  

	* The widget now emits signals for all of the events that are
	interesting (same as the Motif ones, but signalified). 

	* Lots of events are now handled, only missing are the keybaord
	events.
