1998-07-06  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* canvas.c (scramble): Don't flush the X queue now that
	gnome_canvas_update_now() does it for us.
	(create_primitives): Added a test for all the canvas primitives.

1998-07-05  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* canvas.c: Added text to the fifteen game.  The text items change
	color when the mouse enters/leaves the squares.
	(scramble): Added function to scramble the board.

1998-07-01  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* canvas.c (piece_event): Use gnome_canvas_item_move instead of
	re-setting the coordinates explicitly.

1998-06-30  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* canvas.c: Implemented a simple "fifteen" game.  You can move the
	pieces and reorder them to win.  It does not have text yet,
	because I haven't written a GnomeCanvasText item type yet.

	* canvas.c: New test for new canvas -- work in progress.

1998-06-22  Richard Hestilow  <hestgray@ionet.net>
	
	* testgnome.c: 	Fixed icon list (create_icon_list) and changed
			create_pixmap to use gdk_imlib.

Sun Jun 14 13:47:41 1998  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Include GTK_CFLAGS.  Look in intl source
	and build directories.

1998-05-30  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* testgnome.c (create_newwin): Do not connect to the
	"delete_event" when being NORMAL.  This was causing segfaults left
	and right.

Wed Jun 10 14:19:39 EDT 1998 Gregory McLean <gregm@comstar.net>

	* fixed up this so that the canvas is only built if it was built in 
	  libgnomeui.

1998-06-09  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* Makefile.am (testgnome_LDADD): Made it use the libraries from
	the build directories.

	* testgnome.c (create_lamp): adjusted sequence value.

1998-05-27  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* canvas.c: New file to test the canvas.  It is on a separate file
	because it will have a lot of stuff.

	* testgnome.h: New file with declarations useful to the whole program.

Sat May 23 22:10:23 1998  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* testgnome.c: Add a more comprehensive dialog test.

1998-05-11  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* testgnome.c (create_newwin): Create the menus with a data
	pointer.  Add a routine to close the window, and not quit the
	program.
