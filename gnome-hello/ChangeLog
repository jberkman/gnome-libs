	* gnome-hello.sgml: documentation template for GNOME.  It also
	documents the gnome-hello application.

	* gnome-hello.html: adding this to the repository since many users
	might not have the DocBook tools installed.

1998-01-25  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* gnome-hello.c (main): wrote first pass at gnome-hello.c, based
	largely on one of the gtk "hello world" applications.  For now
	this only pops up a "Hello GNOME" button which, when clicked,
	shuts down the application.
