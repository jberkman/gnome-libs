    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>
      The GnomeCanvas widget is a high-level engine for creating
      structured graphics.  A canvas displays a collection of items,
      which can be things like lines, rectangles, ellipses, and text.
      Items have attributes associated to them that you can change, like
      fill color, position, and size.  Items may be moved and re-stacked
      in the canvas, and organized in hierarchical groups of items.
      You can receive mouse and keyboard events from the items and
      perform actions on them based on these events.
    </para>

    <para>
      The canvas is useful for when you want to create interactive
      graphics displays which would be hard or cumbersome to implement
      with raw calls to Gdk, or when writing a custom widget for Gtk
      is inconvenient.

    <title>Organization of items</title>

    <para>
      Items in the canvas are organized in a tree hierarchy.  Items
      can be groups (nodes in the tree), or terminal items (leaves in
      the tree).  Groups can contain any number of children, which can
      be terminal items or other groups.  Thus, items can be nested to
      an arbitrary depth inside a canvas.
    </para>

    <para>
      A canvas has a single root group.  For simple drawings, it is
      likely that you will want to put all your items directly inside
      this group.  For more complex drawings, it may be convenient to
      use a hierarchical structure and make of nested canvas groups.
    </para>

    <para>
      For example, consider a circuit editor.  You could define groups
      that contain the items that are necessary to draw a logic gate.
      Then you could define groups for different components.  A group
      representing an adder would contain several logic gates and some
      wires.  You would then group some adders with other components
      to form a more complex circuit.
    </para>

  <sect1 id="coordinates">

    <title>Coordinates</title>

    <para>
      The canvas uses a world coordinate system with coordinates
      specified as floating point numbers.  World coordinates mean
      that units can represent whatever is most convenient to you:
      meters, pixels, parsecs, etc.
    </para>

    <para>
      Coordinates are calculated from the origin of the canvas, which
      has coordinates (0.0, 0.0).  Positive X coordinates go to the
      right of the origin, and positive Y coordinates go
      <emphasis>below</emphasis> the origin, like in the rest of the X
      Window System &mdash this is a feature, not a bug.
    </para>

    <para>
      Coordinates of items are calculated with respect to their parent
      group.  When a group is moved, its children's logical
      coordinates do not change, although their physical position
      will.  A group stores a single pair of coordinates which define
      its origin relative to its parent group.  The canvas's root
      group starts with its origin in world position (0.0, 0.0).
