 <P
>X imposes a limitiation - that only 1 client can select for button presses
on a window - this is due to the implicit grab nature of button press events
in X. This poses a problem when more than one client wishes to select for
these events on the same window - ie the root window, or in the case of a WM
that has more than one root window (virtual root windows) any of these
windows. The solution to this is to have the client that recieves these
events handle any of the events it is interested in, and then ``proxy'' or
``pass on'' any events it doesnt not care about. Seeing the traditional
model has always been that the WM selects for butotn presses on the desktop,
it is only natural that it keep doing this BUT have a way of sending
unwanted presses onto some other process(es) that may well be interested.</P

 <P

 <P

><UL
>&#13;  <LI
>  <P
>1. Set a property on the root window called _WIN_DESKTOP_BUTTON_PROXY. It is
of the type cardinal - its value is the Window ID of another window that is
not mapped that is created as an immediate child of the root window. This
window also has this property set on it pointing to itself.</P

  bpress_win = ECreateWindow(root, -80, -80, 24, 24, 0);

  XChangeProperty(disp, root, atom_set, XA_CARDINAL, 32,

>2. Whenever the WM gets a button press or release event it can check the
button on the mouse pressed, any modifiers etc. - if the WM wants the event
it can deal with it as per normal and not proxy it on - if the WM does not
wish to do anything as a result of this event, then it shoudl pass the event
along like following:</P

  XUngrabPointer(disp, CurrentTime);
  XSendEvent(disp, bpress_win, False, SubstructureNotifyMask, ev);

  </PRE
></TD
></TR

  <P
>where ev is a pointer to the actual Button press or release event it
receives from the X Server (retaining timestamp, original window ID,
co-ordinates etc.)</P
>

  <P
>NB - the XUngrabPointer is only required before proxying a press, not a
release.</P
>

  <P
>The WM should proxy both button press and release events. It should only
proxy a release if it also proxied the press corresponding to that release.</P
>

  <P
>It is the responsibility of any apps listening for these events (and as many
apps as want to can since they are being sent under the guise of 
SubstructureNotify events), to handle grabbing the pointer again and
handling all events for the mouse while pressed until release etc.</P
