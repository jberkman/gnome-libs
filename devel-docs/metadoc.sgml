      Like any complete piece software, the GNOME Project needs good
      documentation.  This is a book with meta-documentation, or how
      to write documentation for GNOME.  It describes the tools that
      you need to have to write documentation for GNOME, and it also
      explains the conventions GNOME uses regarding user and developer
      documentation.

	GNOME uses DocBook as its documentation back-end.  DocBook is
	built on top of SGML, so multiple tools can be used to process
	the markup source files.  DocBook lets you write markup based
	on the logical structure of your document's content (sections,
	chapters, etc.), instead of the "lower level" method of
	explicitly changing fonts and paragraph styles.  Markup based
	on the logical structure is a good thing because it lets the
	writer concentrate on concent rather than on presentation,
	which can be left to automatic processing tools.  The final
	look of the document is determined by the <emphasis>style
	sheet</emphasis> that is used with the processing tools, so
	different presentation formats can be obtained by changing the
	style sheet.
