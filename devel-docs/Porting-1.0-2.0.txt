		Porting GNOME 1.0 Applications to GNOME 2.0


[this document is still work-in-progress.]

Notation
========

* MODIFIED

  The file/widget/feature has been modified in a source incompatible way,
  but it is possible to reuse old code without completely rewriting it
  (compatibility layer exists, fixable by scripts, ....)

* CHANGED API

  The API of this file/widget/feature has completely changed; it is not
  possible to reuse old code without rewriting at least large parts of it.

* ADDED FUNCTIONALITY

  There is some added functionality over GNOME 1.x.

* OBSOLETE

  The file/widget/feature is obsolete and it has been moved to libcompat.

* REMOVED

  The file/widget/feature has been completely removed, it is not in libcompat.
  This normally means that it is easier to fix code which was using this than
  to provide a compatibility layer.

* NEW

  The file/widget/feature is completely new in GNOME 2.0.

How to prepare your GNOME 1.0 Applications for GNOME 2.0
========================================================

There are some things which you can do in your GNOME 1.0 Application
to make it easier to port them to GNOME 2.0 while still keeping
compatible with the GNOME 1.x platform.

We will add some new functions to the stable version of gnome-libs
after GNOME 1.4 which will help you to archive this. The most important
thing is to use accessor functions rather than accessing widget data
directly whereever it's possible. These new functions will help you
doing this.

* GnomeEntry - MODIFIED

  - this is isn't a GtkCombo any longer, but a GnomeSelector.

  The following functions have been removed:

  - gnome_entry_gtk_entry()

    GnomeEntry isn't a GtkCombo/GtkEntry anymore; use
    gnome_entry_get_text() and gnome_entry_set_text() to access
    the entry text.

  The following functions are deprecated:

  - gnome_entry_get_history_id, gnome_entry_set_history_id
    gnome_entry_get_history_id, gnome_entry_set_max_saved
    gnome_entry_get_max_saved, gnome_entry_prepend_history
    gnome_entry_append_history, gnome_entry_load_history
    gnome_entry_save_history, gnome_entry_clear_history

    Use the corresponding functions in GnomeSelector.

  The following new functions have been added:

  - gnome_entry_get_text(), gnome_entry_set_text()

  These functions will be added to the stable gnome-libs after GNOME 1.4;
  in all existing code. To prepare things in GNOME 1.x:

  - use gnome_entry_get/set_text() rather than gnome_entry_gtk_entry()

  - try not to access any of the 'changed', 'history_id', 'items' and
    'max_saved' fields in the GnomeEntry directly, they will be private
    in GNOME 2.0.

* GnomeFileEntry - OBSOLETE

  - this has been replaced by GnomeFileSelector.

* GnomeIconEntry - MODIFIED + ADDED FUNCTIONALITY

  - this is now derived from GnomeFileSelector instead of GtkVBox.
  - previously, the difference between GnomeIconEntry and GnomePixmapEntry
    was that you could specify the size of the preview in a GnomePixmapEntry;
    this functionality has been moved into GnomeIconEntry so that
    GnomePixmapEntry is now obsolete.

  The following functions have been removed:

  - gnome_icon_entry_gnome_file_entry(): use parent class
  - gnome_icon_entry_gnome_entry (): use parent class
  - gnome_icon_entry_gtk_entry (): don't suck things out of this directly

  The following functions are deprecated:

  - gnome_icon_entry_set_pixmap_subdir(): Fixme, Fixme.
  - gnome_icon_entry_set_icon(): use gnome_selector_set_uri().

  The following new functions have been added:

  - gnome_icon_entry_get_icon_selector ()
  - gnome_icon_entry_set_preview_size (): formerly in GnomePixmapEntry.

  Other source incompatible changes:

  - `fentry', `pickbutton', `pick_dialog', `pick_dialog_dir' have been
    removed from the GnomeIconEntry instance struct.

* GnomePixmapEntry - OBSOLETE

  - this has been obsoleted by GnomeIconEntry.

* GnomeCalculator - REMOVED

  - this has been moved to libcompat for the moment; it should go somewhere
    else, but not in libgnomeui.

* GnomeNumberEntry - REMOVED

  - this was using GnomeCalculator and has been moved to libcompat as well.

* GnomeProcBar - REMOVED

  - this was only used in GTop and some applets; it has been moved into GTop.
  - the three applets will be moved into GTop as well to share some code with
    it for GNOME 2.0.

* gnome-properties, gnome-property-entries - REMOVED

  - this was only used in GTop and some applets; it is totally obsolete due
    to GConf.
