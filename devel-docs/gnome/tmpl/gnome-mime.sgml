Routines to find out the mime type of a file.

<!-- ##### SECTION Long_Description ##### -->
<para>
The routines in gnome-mime provide a way to find the MIME type of a
file and some utility functions.  
</para>

<para>
There are two different methods for finding out the MIME type of a
file: those where only the file name is used to find the MIME type: in
this case the name is matched against a database of known extensions
and regular expressions; and a routine that will try to guess the MIME
type of the file by peeking at the contents of the file.  The former
routines only do in-memory operations, while the later need to perform
a possible time expensive operation to figure out the information.
</para>

<para>
The routines that classify a file by its name, use the contents of all
of the files with the extension <filename>.mime</filename> from the
<filename>$gnome_prefix/share/mime-info</filename> directory and the
<filename>~/.gnome/mime-info</filename> to build the database for
filename matching.  The latter is supported to enable users to provide
their mime types to extend the system defaults.</para>

<para>Application that wish to install their own MIME types only need
to install a file in this directory.
</para>

<para>
The file <filename>$gnome/share/mime-info/gnome.mime</filename> is
special, as it contains the defaults for gnome, and is read first.  In
addition, the file <filename>~/.gnome/mime-info/user.mime</filename> is
read last.  This will guarantee that there is a way to set system
defaults, and there is a way for the user to override them.  There is
currently no way to tell anything about the order of the other files in
those directories, nor is there anyway to override system defaults yet.
</para>


<para>
The <function>gnome_mime_type_from_magic</function> Uses the contents
of the file <filename>$gnome_prefix/etc/mime-magic</filename> to
determine the contents of a file (this database is usually kept in a
fast machine-preprocessed format in the
<filename>$gnome_prefix/etc/mime-magic.dat</filename> file).
