      <title>What is GNOME..</title>
      <para>
	GNOME stands for GNU Network Object Model Environment. The GNOME
	project intends to build a complete, user-friendly desktop based
	entirely on free software. GNOME is part of the GNU project. The
	desktop will consist of small utilities and larger applications which
	share a consistent look and feel. GNOME uses GTK as the GUI toolkit
	for all GNOME-compliant applications.

      <title>This document.</title>
      <para>
        <emphasis>WARNING</emphasis>: this tutorial is in really early stages.
        So it's almost empty and hasn't been checked. Uglier, GNOME is in early
        stages too, so it's APIs are changing very frequently and the info here
        is probably inaccurate. When this document and the code disagree, the
        code wins. :-)
        </para>
      <para>
        As a new GNOME developer i've had some trouble finding info about
        how to do some things (and the people on the list were being a bit
        annoyed with my questions.) So i'm trying to do it easy for you,
        the developers that come after me.
        </para>
      <para>
        This document is intended to be not only a tutorial, but a reference
        too. I hope it growing to be the ultimate guide to the GNOME internals.
        I would like including here the architecture notes that now are in
        the website and the style guide.
        </para>

        If you add or change some API please document it here.

      <para>
        GNOME is intendeed to support any languages. But you need to have
        GTK+ and GNOME bindings for your particular language. Our prefereed
        languages are C and scheme (using guile.) There are bindings too
        for Objective C. There are GTK bindings for C++ (Gtk--) and for
        Perl, but afaik there aren't very good and still there aren't bindings
        for gnome stuff for these languages.

        When you've made your changes you need to make a diff... The best

        </literallayout>
        [FIXME: Does it work with anonimous CVS?]
        After it send the diffs file to <email>gnome-list@gnome.org</email>.
	In a short time someone of the core hackers will answer you and he
	is going to be your "GNOME godfather". Then, and until you have a
	CVS account send your patches to him.

    <title>GNOME Hello! revised.</title>
      <para>
	From the gnome-hello manual:
	</para>
      <para>
	gnome-hello is a GNOME application which contains all the essential
	and common features of GNOME programs, such as initialization, event
	loops, configuration file parsing, internationalization and so forth.
	</para>
      <para>	
	gnome-hello is intended to be an example of the GNOME coding
	standards, as well as a fun and useless little program.
	</para>
      <para>
	Similarly, gnome-hello is documented in the manner typical of GNOME 
	applications. 
        </para>

      <sect1 id="parsing">
      	<title>Parsing parameters.</title>
      	<para>
      	  Well, Carsten and Tom are talking about standarizing it, so i'll

	</sect1>
	
      <sect1 id="i18n">
      	<title>Internationalization.</title>
      	<para>
	  Internationalization (i18n for short) is very easy with GNOME. We
	  use GNU gettext. You need to initialize it with: 
	  <literal>textdomain (PACKAGE);</literal> in your main function. 
	  After it you only need to add a _() to all the strings that need 
	  translation.
      	  </para>
      	<para>
      	  You will need add your file to po/POTFILES.in. Then you can do
      	  <literal>make gnome.pot;make update-po</literal>, edit the .po file
      	  corresponding to you tongue and do <literal>make install</literal>.
      	  Now try your program... Wow! It's speaking in Spanish/Finnish/Latin...
      	  </para>
      	<para>
      	  <emphasis>Warning</emphasis>: _() is a macro for the gettext. So
      	  it won't work when initializing arrays of strings or structs. Then
      	  you need use the N_() macro around the strings and when you use
      	  them do the _() stuff (see the <literal>create_menu</literal> function
      	  for an example.) If you want know more about it read the info
      	  documentation of GNU gettext.
      	  [FIXME: is my explanation correct? I haven't read a C book in the
      	  last 5 years so i don't remember when you can't call functions
      	  in init's]
