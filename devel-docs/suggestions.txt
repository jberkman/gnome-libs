Suggestions for enhancing the user experience in your application:

Try to use:

   - For standard menu items (Save, Save As, Close, Quit, etc), use
     the macros defined in gnome-app-helper.h, e.g.
     GNOMEUIINFO_MENU_EXIT_ITEM(cb, data)

   - GnomePropertyBox widgets for configuring things in your
     application.  These will allow the user to use their prefered way
     of configuring the application.

   - If you only want to ask the user a question from a set of
     options, you can use the gnome-messagebox code.

   - When creating dialog boxes, use a GnomeDialog widget, instead of
     a GtkWindow.

   - Use the gtk_dialog_set_parent routine if possible, to "bind" your
     dialog boxes to your main toplevel window (this allows window
     managers to hide all of your dialog box windows when minimizing
     your main window for example).

   - Use the GnomeApp widget for your toplevel windows.

   - Use the gnome-app-helper.h interface for creating menus and
     toolbars.  If you use this, the task of creating Baboon-aware
     applications will be reduced.

   - Use GnomePixmap to load your images.

   - GNOME uses Imlib, try to provide your images in PNG format.  Do
     not care about the color usage, Imlib will dither to a nice
     palette on low-end displays.

   - For text-input that might benefit from a history, use the
     GnomeEntry widget (this will provide automatic history for you).

   - For file-input entry widgets, use the GnomeFileEntry widget, this
     will provde a browse selector (and in the future it will use the
     enhanced file open dialog box).

   - When you require an entry for typing in an icon name, use the
     GnomeIconEntry widget. 

   - Try to use consistant spacing and padding everywhere.
     libgnomeui/gnome-uidefs.h has some preset values to use.
