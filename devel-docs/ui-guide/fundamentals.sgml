    <title>Compliancy levels</title>
    <para>
    This document will often speak of "GNOME compliancy levels".  Programs
    can be assigned ratings of conformance to the GNOME User Interface
    Guidelines based on these compliancy levels.
    </para>
    <para>
    The purpose of having compliancy levels is to let developers
    progressively implement features of the GNOME user interface into
    their programs, by being able to know which of those features are more
    important than others.
    </para>
    <para>
    When this document describes a particular user interface feature, it
    will be labeled with a specific compliancy level so that developers
    can implement those features in an orderly fashion.
    </para>
    <para>
    There are five compliancy levels for the GNOME user interface:
      <itemizedlist>
         <listitem><para>GNOME compliancy level 1 (G1) - Mandatory</para>
           <para>
           All applications are expected to have G1 features.  These
           are meant to be the bare minimum user interface features
           that applications should have.
           </para>

         <listitem>
           <para>
           GNOME compliancy level 2 (G2) - Highly recommended
           </para>
           <para>
           Features in the G2 level are to be expected in the final version
           of an application (i.e. one that is past the beta stage).  All GNOME
           applications of release-quality are expected to have G2 features.
           </para>
         <listitem>
           <para>
           GNOME compliancy level 3 (G3) - Suggested
           </para>
           <para>
           Features in the G3 level are not to be expected in applications.
           These are features that may not be applicable in all situations, are
           hard to implement, or are beyond the call of duty.  It is suggested
           that very polished applications try to implement G3 features.
           </para>
         <listitem>
           <para>
           GNOME compliancy level 4 (G4) - Nice to have
           </para>
           <para>
           Features in the C4 level are minor conveniences that developers may
           not decide to implement.  Users will experience C4 level features as
           ocassionaly useful, but definitely not needed for a functional user
           interface.
           </para>
         <listitem>
           <para>
           GNOME compliancy level 5 (G5) - Experimental features
           </para>
           <para>
           Features in the G5 level are experimental user interface conventions
           that are in development.  As such, they may have not been formalized
           enough for developers to use consistently.  It is recommended that no
           release-quality application have G5 level features -- only development
           and proof-of-concept programs should use these when appropriate.
           </para>
           <para>
           When features in the G5 level are formalized enough to be included in
           the G1-G4 levels, they will be moved there and cease to be
           experimental features.  It is recommended that the original developers
           of G5 features help application developers integrate these new
           features in their applications.
