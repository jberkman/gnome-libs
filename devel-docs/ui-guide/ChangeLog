1999-12-19  Jörg Rathlev  <joerg@jrsoftware.de>

	* ui-guide.sgml: Broke the document into parts.
	Added Part I - Introduction.

	* intro.sgml: New file, contains introduction.

	Note: The document is currently invalid because empty parts
	(Appendixes is empty) are not allowed in DocBook. This will be
	fixed with the next revision.

	* references.sgml: New file which contains the bibliography
	that was in ui-guide.sgml. The file now uses bibliography markup.
	I also added some books to the bibliography.

	* ui-guide.sgml: Added references.sgml to the list of entities
	and replaced bibliogrpahy with entity.
	Added Martin Wahlen (who does not work on the document any more,
	but has contributed earlier by porting it to DocBook) and myself
	to the authors section.
	Moved the content of about.sgml into an abstract element in the
	bookinfo (ui-guide.sgml).
	Added a first draft of the planned structure as a comment.

	* about.sgml: Removed. The content is now in ui-guide.sgml. The
	chapter will eventually be replaced by an introduction.
 

1998-11-02  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	Indented the UI Guidelines prettily and fixed a couple of markup
	bloopers.

	* fundamentals.sgml: Added the "Levels of usage" section by
	as387@yfn.ysu.edu (what is this guy's name?).

1998-08-25  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* components.sgml: New file.  This comes from the old
	ui-guide.txt file -- the UI Components section seems to have
	disappeared when it was converted to SGML.

	* ui-guide.sgml: Added the components.sgml file to the list of
	entities.

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Added the sgml files to EXTRA_DIST.

	* about.sgml: 
	* develinfo.sgml: 
	* fundamentals.sgml: Added the sgml variables at the end of the
	file to keep emacs happy.

	* ui-guide.sgml: Fixes to the authors and copyright.

1998-08-20  Martin Wahlen <mva@sbbs.se>

	* ui-guide.sgml: Broke it into documents by chapter, rather
	than a large on containing all the information.

1998-08-10  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* ui-guide.sgml: New sgml version of the GNOME UI Guidelines,
	courtesy of Martin Wahlén (mwahlen@soundfound.com).

1998-08-07  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* ui-guide.txt: New file with the GNOME User Interface Guidelines.
	This is a work in progress.
