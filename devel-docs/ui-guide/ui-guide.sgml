      <title>About this book</title>

      <para>
        This book contains the user interface guidelines that developers
        should follow when writing applications for the GNU Network
        Object Model Environment (GNOME).
      </para>

      <para>
        One of the main goals of the GNOME project is to provide a
        consistent graphical user interface for applications.  Users can
        benefit greatly from a uniform and consistent look-and-feel
        among applications.  When a group of programs share the same
        philosophy about the user interface, users can just learn the
        interface to one of those programs and apply their knowledge on
        the rest of them, without having to re-learn different user
        interface conventions for each program.
      </para>

      <para>
        This document describes the philosophy of the GNOME user
        interface and contains ways in which developers may access the
        standard user interface elements of GNOME.  Wherever possible,
        it contains source code examples that can be used to implement
        this functionality.  It also provides examples of how not to
        design user interfaces for GNOME applications; these appear with
        an explanation regarding why these examples are "bad design" and
        how to correct them.

	<para>
	  This part of the GNOME User Interface Guidelines explains
	  basic methods used to create an effective user interface.
	  You will learn about the different ways in which users
	  interact with their computer and find out how you can best
	  support the user in accomplishing his tasks.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The information found in this part is not GNOME specific
	  can easily be transferred to other operating systems and
	  desktop environments.
