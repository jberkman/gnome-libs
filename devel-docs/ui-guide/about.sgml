  This document contains the user interface guidelines that developers
  should follow when writing applications for the GNU Network Object
  Model Environment (GNOME).

  One of the main goals of the GNOME project is to provide a consistent
  graphical user interface for applications.  Users can benefit greatly
  from a uniform and consistent look-and-feel among applications.  When
  a group of programs share the same philosophy about the user
  interface, users can just learn how to use the user interface for any
  one of those programs and apply their knowledge on the rest of them,
  without having to re-learn a different user interface.

  <para>
  This document describes the philosophy of the GNOME user interface and
  contains ways in which developers may access the standard user
  interface elements of GNOME.  Wherever possible, it contains source
  code examples that can be used to implement this functionality.  It
  also provides examples of how not to design user interfaces for GNOME
  applications; these appear with an explanation regarding why these
  examples are "bad design" and how to correct them.
