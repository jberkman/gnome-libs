      <para>
	This book is written for developers and designers of products
	for the GNU Network Object Model Environment (GNOME). You can
	use the information found in this book to design and improve
	the user interface of your GNOME products and to make your
	products look and behave consistent with other GNOME products.
      </para>

      <para>
	This book does not require that you are a GNOME expert, it is
	intended for experienced GNOME developers as well as for beginners
	and developers coming from other platforms. You should however
	have a good knowledge of graphical user interfaces in general
	(e.g. you are an experienced user of Microsoft Windows or a
	Macintosh Computer), and you should be familiar with the
	terminology used to describe graphical user interfaces.
      </para>

      <para>
	Even if you're currently not developing any GNOME products, this
	book will be a valuable resource for you. Reading this book will
	help you to understand the concepts of GNOME and can help you in
	your decision whether to develop future products for GNOME.
      </para>

      <para>
	You should also read this book if you're interested in user
	interface design in general. This book provides you with lots of
	useful information and many of the principles and techniques
	presented here can easily be transferred to other environments.
