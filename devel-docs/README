This directory contains an example configuration for the libgnome and
libgnomui parts of gnome-libs.

I've created the gnome-docs.sgml and gnome-sections.txt based on a fairly
recent checkout of the sources (13 Dec 1998) so these could be used
for the real documentation (and the same goes for gnomeui).

Note that the Makefile.am files in the gnome and gnomeui subdirectories
use a relative path to the source code directory, which may need to be
changed depending on where the documentation is actually placed.

Note also that the libgnomeui library contains GtkObjects and so the scan
target also uses gtkdoc-scanobj.

When added to gnome-libs a separate configure.in may not be necessary.


You may also need .cvsignore files to ignore all the generated files
(everything except MODULE-sections.txt, MODULE-types.txt (if the module has
GtkObjects in it), MODULE-docs.sgml and the templates in the tmpl directory,
I think).
