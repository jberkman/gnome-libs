This is the first release of gdoc, the GNOME Documenter. 

It's intended to be used to autodocument the GNOME libgnome/libgnomeui API.

DOCUMENTING YOUR APIs
=====================

	Just add comments in the headers. For an example see gnome-about.h.

USING gdoc
==========

	You shouldn't need it unless you're enough brave to want to change
the code. I'm going to run it frequently to have it actualized. 

	If you want risks, get the c2man 2.41's sources (i've downloaded them
from ftp.debian.org) and patch it with c2man-to-gdoc-patch, compile and install
it. Now when you run make in devel-docs, it should detect it and generate the
new doc's.

CHANGING IT/HOW DOES IT WORKS
=============================

	Well, if you want to maintain the code, it's yours...

	After spending some time trying to understand how c2man works and
failing, i give up and started gdb.

	The result is really ugly. I wrote a new output_manual_pages that
dumps the c2man's structs to perl-code. This code is catched by gdoc.pl
and it generates the docbook output.
